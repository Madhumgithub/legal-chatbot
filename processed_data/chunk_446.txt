that a neighbouring shop had the CCTV footage which be directed to be preserved nor the accused summoned any witness from the said shop. Moreover, there is nothing in the testimonies of PW-1 and PW-2 that they had any motive for the false implication of the accused persons. Nothing State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 24/36 could be elicit in the cross-examination of PW-1 and PW-2 to that effect. Hence, the court is not in agreement with the contentions of the Ld. Counsel that no CCTV footage having been filed on the record, gave rise to a reasonable doubt in their favour. Accordingly, the same stands rejected. 43. Having discussed the different pleas of the accused persons, now let us see if the prosecution has been able to prove the offences with which accused persons have been charged. To decide the same, we again have to revert back to the testimonies of PW-1 Nishant and PW-2 Pawan Kakkar. A careful perusal of their testimonies would show that the accused Adatiya@ Akash and Peter Joseph entered to their office alongwith knife and pistol respectively. They both have deposed that accused Adatiya @ Akash caused hurt with a knife on the person of PW-1 Nishant and accused Peter Joseph hit the butt of the pistol on the head of PW-2 Pawan Kakkar. It is to be seen whether the oral version of PW-1 and PW-2 find any corroboration from the medical documents on the record or not. The MLC Ex.PW-11/A of PW-1 Nishant shows that he was brought to the hospital at about 10 p.m on 24.03.2015 where doctor noted superficial incised wound over right thumb. PW-1 Nishant deposed that when accused Adatiya@ Akash attacked him, he tried to ward off the attack with his hand due to which he sustained cut injury on his right thumb. Thus, MLC Ex.PW-11/A corroborates the oral version of PW-1 Nishant. 44. Similarly, MLC Ex.PW-11/B of PW-2 Pawan Kakkar would reveal that he was brought in the hospital on 24.03.2015 at about 9.45 p.m. Doctor noted CLW over right parietal region of State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 25/36 the skull as well as abrasion over left zygomatic bone. The zygomatic bone is a bone on the cheek of a human being. Thus, the injury on the MLC of PW-2 also corroborates the version of both the PWs. 45. The Ld. Counsel for accused tried to show from the medical document of the witnesses that the witnesses were not brought together at the hospital. They pointed out that as per the MLC Ex.PW-11/B, the time of arrival of PW-2 was shown as 9.45 p.m whereas as per the MLC State vs Mohd. Yakub Etc on 29 March, 2025 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20389847/ 15 Ex.PW-11/A of PW-1, the time of arrival was shown as 10 p.m. However, this court is not willing to accept the contentions of the Ld. Counsel for the reasons, firstly that
