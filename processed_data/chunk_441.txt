and 394 IPC is that the hurt u/s 392 IPC is caused with a view of commit robbery wherein u/s 394 IPC, the hurt is not necessary to commit theft. This can be understood by the use of words 'for that end' in Section 390 IPC. State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 16/36 Moreover, Section 392 IPC is applicable in a case of complete robbery and is not applicable where the robbery falls short of completion and in other words there was only an attempt. 28. Section 397 IPC is applicable when at the time of committing robbery or dacoity, the offender uses any deadly weapon or causes grievous hurt to any person or attempts to cause death or grievous hurt to any person. It applies to the offender who uses the deadly weapon in commission of the offence. It is settled law that the word 'use' does not mean that the weapon must have been actually used. The word 'use' denotes that if the weapon is within the sight of the victim and was capable of causing terror in his mind, then the offender can be said to have used the weapon. For example, if the offender has hidden a pistol underneath the belt of his pants covered by the shirt not tucked up into the pants and the offender shows the pistol by lifting the shirt in order to show the pistol to the victim, the weapon can be said to have been used for the purpose of Section 397 IPC. Furthermore, Section 397 is applicable to the situation where the offence of robbery is complete. 29. Section 398 IPC is applicable to the situation where the offender does not use the weapon but is armed with any deadly weapon. Thus, the stark difference between Section 397 IPC and 398 IPC is that u/s 397 IPC, the weapon must have been used but for the purpose of Section 398 IPC, it is not necessary that the weapon must be used but it is sufficient if the offender is armed with deadly weapon. Section 398 IPC is applicable where the offence of robbery or dacoity is not complete and there remains an attempt only whereas S. 397 applies to a complete robbery. State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 17/36 30. It is further settled that Section 397 and 398 IPC are not substantive offences but they only regulate the punishment. In addition to that, it can be said that Section 392 IPC corresponds to Section 397 IPC whereas Section 393 IPC corresponds to Section 398 IPC. State vs Mohd.
