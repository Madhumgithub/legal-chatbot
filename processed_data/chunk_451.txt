the possession of the country made pistol containing a live cartridge allegedly recovered at his instance from underneath driving seat of the car. State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 32/36 57. After having carefully gone through the prosecution evidence in this regard, this court is of the opinion that the alleged recovery of country made pistol containing one live cartridge at the instance of accused Peter Joseph from his case is not free from embellishments or doubt. PW-14 IO Inspector Raj Pal Meena deposed that 25.03.2015 he prepared a raiding party consisting of himself, Ct. Ombir, Ct. Mahavir Singh and HC Sunil (PW-14, PW-7, PW-9 and PW-13 respectively). The seizure memo Ex.PW-13/C of the country made pistol containing the live cartridge shows that it was got recovered by accused Peter Joseph from underneath the driver seat of silver colour Accent Car bearing no. DL9CG 7012. IO PW-14 Inspector Raj Pal deposed the same as well. However, the other members of the police team did not corroborate his versions. PW-13 ASI Sunil deposed that the pistol was got recovered by the accused persons near the driver seat of the car. PW-9 HC Mahavir Singh also deposed that the pistol was got recovered by the accused persons from near the driver seat of the car. Thus, there is a reasonable doubt as to the exact place from where the alleged pistol containing live cartridge was recovered. 58. Moreover, there is also a reasonable doubt about the fact that as to how the silver colour Accent Car bearing no. DL9CG 7012 was brought to the police station. PW-13 ASI Sunil deposed that he was not aware as to who brought the said car to the police station. However, PW-9 HC Mahavir Singh deposed that the said car was brought to the police station by HC Sunil (PW-13). If PW-13 HC Sunil brought the car to the police station, he would State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 33/36 not have forgotten the same. Thus, a reasonable doubt has crept in the prosecution story in regard to the aforesaid fact. 59. Another infirmity in the prosecution case in regard to the aforesaid fact is that PW-7 HC Ombir Singh was also part of the raiding team which recovered the country made pistol containing a live cartridge and the Accent Car of the accused Peter Joseph. PW-14 IO Inspector Raj Pal deposed that same. However, PW-9 HC Mahavir Singh and PW-13 ASI Sunil did not depose if Ct. Ombir Singh State vs Mohd. Yakub Etc on 29 March, 2025 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20389847/ 19 was also the part of the raiding party on 25.03.215 at the time of recovery of country made pistol and Accent Car. PW-7 Ct. Ombir Singh himself did not depose anything if he also took part in the investigation on 25.03.2015. Therefore, a doubt remains if PW-7 Ct. Ombir Singh was involved in the investigation on 25.03.2015 or not. 60.
