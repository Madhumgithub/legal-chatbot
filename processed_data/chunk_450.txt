parameters required thereto, but in view of the fact that the knife recovered in this case was not operated with any mechanical device to open or close it, did not make the knife to be covered under Arms Act, Thus, the prosecution has failed to prove the offence u/s 25/27 Arms Act against the accused Adatiya@ Akash as the knife recovered from his was not covered within the parameters of DAD notification dated 29.10.1980. 54. Now comes the question whether the cartridge recovered at the spot which allegedly fell from the pistol, held by the Peter is an ammunition or not. As per the case of the prosecution, the pistole was recovered at the instance of accused Peter from a car parked infornt of H. No. 777, JJ Colony, Khyala, New Delhi. The said country made pistol was recovered alongwith live cartridge from underneath of the driving seat of the car. The said pistole alongwith cartridge recovered at the spot as well as live cartridge were sent to the FSL.
