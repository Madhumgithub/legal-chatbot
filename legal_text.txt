blow given to Y.

imprisonment awarded, with intervals between the periods of solitary confinement of not less duration 
than such periods. 
2[75. Enhanced punishment for certain offences under Chapter XII or Chapter XVII after 
previous conviction.—Whoever, having been convicted,— 
(a) by a Court in 3[India], of an offence punishable under Chapter XII or Chapter XVII of this 
Code with imprisonment of either description for a term of three years or upwards, 4*** 
5*

CHAPTER IV 
GENERAL EXCEPTIONS 
76. Act done by a person bound, or by mistake of fact believing himself bound, by law.—
Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by 
reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be, bound by law to do it. 
Illustrations 
(a) A, a soldier, fires on a mob by the order of his superior officer, in conformity with the commands of the law. A has 
committed no offence. 
(b) A, an officer of a Court of Justice, being ordered by that Court to arrest Y, and after due enquiry, believing Z to be Y, 
arrests Z. A has committed no offence. 
77. Act of Judge when acting judicially.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a Judge when 
acting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or which in good faith he believes to be, given to 
him by law. 
78. Act done pursuant to the judgment or order of Court.—Nothing which is done in pursuance 
of, or which is warranted by the judgment or order of, a Court of Justice; if done whilst such judgment or 
order remains in force, is an offence, notwithstanding the Court may have had no jurisdiction to pass such 
judgment or order, provided the person doing the act in good faith believes that the Court had such 
jurisdiction. 
                                                           
1. Subs. by Act 8 of 1862, s. 5, for “be less than a”. 
2. Subs. by Act 3 of 1910, s. 2, for section 75. 
3. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A. O. 1948, the A. O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch., 
to read as above. 
4. The word “or” omitted by Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch. 
5. Cl. (b) omitted by s. 3 and the Sch., ibid. 
6. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). 

26 
 
79. Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself, justified, by law.—
Nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake 
of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith, believes himself to be justified by law, in 
doing it. 
Illustration 
A sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A, in the exercise, to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, of 
the power which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murderers in the fact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper 
authorities. A has committed no offence, though it may turn out that Z was acting in self-defence. 
80. Accident in doing a lawful act.—Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, 
and without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful 
means and with proper care and caution. 
Illustration 
A is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here, if there was no want of proper 
caution on the part of A, his act is excusable and not an offence. 
81. Act likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other harm.—
Nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause 
harm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of 
preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property. 
Explanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was 
of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that 
it was likely to cause harm. 
Illustrations 
(a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly, and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a 
position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, 
unless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with 
only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the 
boat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, 
though he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of 
fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C. 
(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention 
in good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so 
imminent as to excuse A's act, A is not guilty of the offence. 
82. Act of a child under seven years of age.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under 
seven years of age.  
83. Act of a child above seven and under twelve of immature understanding.—Nothing is an 
offence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under twelve, who has not attained 
sufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that 
occasion. 
84. Act of a person of unsound mind.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the 
time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that 
he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. 
85. Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will.—
Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, 
incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong, or contrary to  
law: provided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or 
against his will. 
86. Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.—
In cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person 
who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge 
as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was 
administered to him without his knowledge or against his will. 

27 
 
87. Act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, done by 
consent.—Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the 
doer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, 
or be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen years of age, who has given consent, 
whether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the 
doer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm. 
Illustration 
A and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the consent of each to suffer any harm 
which, in the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no 
offence. 
88. Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person's benefit.—
Nothing, which is not intented to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or 
be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose 
benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that 
harm, or to take the risk of that harm. 
Illustration 
A, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who suffers under the painful complaint, 
but not intending to cause Z's death, and intending, in good faith, Z's benefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z's consent. A 
has committed no offence. 
89. Act done in good faith for benefit of child or insane person, by or by consent of guardian.—
Nothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or of unsound 
mind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of 
that person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause 
or be known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person: Provided— 
Provisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or to the 
attempting to cause death; 
Secondly.—That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing 
it knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous 
hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; 
Thirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the 
attempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or 
the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; 
Fourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing 
of which offence it would not extend. 
Illustration 
A, in good faith, for his child's benefit without his child's consent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon knowing it to 
be likely that the operation will cause the child's death, but not intending to cause the child's death. A is within the exception,  
inasmuch as his object was the cure of the child. 
90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.—A consent is not such a consent as 
is intended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a 
misconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent 
was given in consequence of such fear or misconception; or 
Consent of insane person.—if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or 
intoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or 
Consent of child.—unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person 
who is under twelve years of age. 
91. Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm cause.—The exceptions in 
sections 87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which they 
may cause, or be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or 
on whose behalf the consent is given. 

28 
 
Illustration 
Causing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) is offence independently 
of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of such harm”; 
and the consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act. 
92. Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent.—Nothing is an offence by 
reason of any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without 
that person's consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, 
or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of 
him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: Provided— 
Provisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or the 
attempting to cause death; 
Secondly.—That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing it 
knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or 
the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; 
Thirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to 
cause hurt, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt; 
Fourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing of 
which offence it would not extend. 
Illustrations 
(a) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to be trepanned. A, not intending Z's 
death, but in good faith, for Z's benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers his power of judging for himself. A has committed 
no offence. 
(b) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill Z, but not intending to kill Z, 
and in good faith intending Z's benefit. A's ball gives Z a mortal wound. A has committed no offence. 
(c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an operation be immediately performed. 
There is not time to apply to the child's guardian. A performs the operation in spite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in 
good faith, the child's benefit. A has committed no offence. 
(d) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A drops the child from the housestop, 
knowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child's 
benefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the fall, A has committed no offence. 
Explanation.—Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of sections 88, 89 and 92. 
93. Communication made in good faith.—No communication made in good faith is an offence by 
reason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person. 
Illustration 
A, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live. The patient dies in consequence of the 
shock. A has committed no offence, though he knew it to be likely that the communication might cause the patient's death. 
94. Act to which a person is compelled by threats.—Except murder, and offences against the State 
punishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by 
threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person 
will otherwise be the consequence: Provided the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a 
reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which 
he became subject to such constraint. 
Explanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, joins a 
gang of dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the ground of 
his having been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law. 
Explanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant death, to do a 
thing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of 
a house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception. 

29 
 
95. Act causing slight harm.—Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to 
cause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of 
ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm. 
Of the Right of Private Defence 
96. Things done in private defence.—Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the 
right of private defence. 
97. Right of private defence of the body and of property.—Every person has a right, subject to the 
restrictions contained in section 99, to defend— 
First.—His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human 
body; 
Secondly.—The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against 
any act which is an offence falling under the defintion of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or 
which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass. 
98. Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc.—When an act, 
which would otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of 
maturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by 
reason of any misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence 
against that act which he would have if the act were that offence. 
Illustrations 
(a) Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence. But A has the same right of private 
defence which he would have if Z were sane. 
(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A. 
Here Z, by attacking A under this misconception, commits no offence. But A has the same right of private defence against Z, 
which he would have if Z were not acting under that misconception. 
99. Acts against which there is no right of private defence.—There is no right of private defence 
against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or 
attempted to be done, by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that act, 
may not be strictly justifiable by law. 
There is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension 
of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant acting in 
good faith under colour of his office, though that direction may not be strictly justifiable by law. 
There is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to protection of 
the public authorities. 
Extent to which the right may be exercised.—The right of private defence in no case extends to the 
inflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence. 
Explanation 1.—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done, or 
attempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows or has reason to believe, that the 
person doing the act is such public servant. 
Explanation 2.—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done, or 
attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that 
the person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such person states the authority under which 
he acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded. 
100. When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death.—The right of 
private defence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in the last preceding section, to the 
voluntary causing of death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the offence which occasions the 
exercise of the right be of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:— 
First.—Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that death will otherwise be the 
consequence of such assault; 

30 
 
Secondly.—Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will 
otherwise be the consequence of such assault; 
Thirdly.—An assault with the intention of committing rape; 
Fourthly.—An assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust; 
Fifthly.—An assault with the intention of kidnapping or abducting; 
Sixthly.—An assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under circumstances which 
may reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to the public authorities 
for his release. 
1[Seventhly.—An act of throwing or administering acid or an attempt to throw or administer acid 
which may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of 
such act.] 
101. When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.—If the offence be not of 
any of the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding section, the right of private defence of the body 
does not extend to the voluntary causing of death to the assailant, but does extend, under the restrictions 
mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than death. 
102. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body.—The right of 
private defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises 
from an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed; and it 
continues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues. 
103. When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death.—The right of 
private defence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary 
causing of death or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the 
attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right, be an offence of any of the descriptions 
hereinafter enumerated, namely:— 
First.—Robbery; 
Secondly.—House-breaking by night; 
Thirdly.—Mischief by fire committed on any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is 
used as a human dwelling, or as a place for the custody of property; 
Fourthly.—Theft, mischief, or house-trespass, under such circumstances as may reasonably cause 
apprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence, if such right of private defence is not 
exercised. 
104. When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.—If the offence, the 
committing of which, or the attempting to commit which occasions the exercise of the right of private 
defence, be theft, mischief, or criminal trespass, not of any of the descriptions enumerated in the last 
preceding section, that right does not extend to the voluntary causing of death, but does extend, subject to 
the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the wrong-doer of any harm other 
than death. 
105. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of property.—The right of 
private defence of property commences when a reasonable apprehension of danger to the property 
commences. 
The right of private defence of property against theft continues till the offender has effected his retreat 
with the property or either the assistance of the public authorities is obtained, or the property has been 
recovered. 
The right of private defence of property against robbery continues as long as the offender causes or 
attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or as long as the fear of instant death or 
of instant hurt or of instant personal restraint continues. 
The right of private defence of property against criminal trespass or mischief continues as long as the 
offender continues in the commission of criminal trespass or mischief. 
                                                           
1. Ins. by Act 13 of 2013, s. 2 (w.e.f. 3-2-2013). 

31 
 
The right of private defence of property against house-breaking by night continues as long as the 
house-trespass which has been begun by such house-breaking continues. 
106. Right of private defence against deadly assault when there is risk of harm to innocent 
person.—If in the exercise of the right of private defence against an assault which reasonably causes the 
apprehension of death, the defender be so situated that he cannot effectually exercise that right without 
risk of harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence extends to the running of that risk. 
Illustration 
A is attacked by a mob who attempt to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his right of private defence without firing 
on the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young children who are mingled with the mob. A commits no offence if 
by so firing he harms any of the children. 
CHAPTER V 
OF ABETMENT 
107. Abetment of a thing.—A person abets the doing of a thing, who— 
First.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or 
Secondly.—Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that 
thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of 
that thing; or 
Thirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing. 
Explanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material 
fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing 
to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. 
Illustration 
A, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z, B, knowing that fact and also that C is 
not Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the 
apprehension of C. 
Explanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in 
order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid 
the doing of that act. 
108. Abettor.—A person abets an offence, who abets either the commission of an offence, or the 
commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing 
an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. 
Explanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence although 
the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act. 
Explanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should 
be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused. 
Illustrations 
(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder. 
(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of 
instigating B to commit murder. 
Explanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an 
offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty 
intention or knowledge. 
 
 

32 
 
Illustrations 
(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a 
person capable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or 
not, is guilty of abetting an offence. 
(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death. 
B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable 
by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an 
offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. 
(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of 
knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's 
instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to 
the punishment provided for that offence. 
(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A 
induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's 
property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of 
abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. 
Explanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is 
also an offence. 
Illustration 
A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in 
consequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B 
to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment. 
Explanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that 
the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the 
conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. 
Illustration 
A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then explains the plan to C 
mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and 
procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in 
consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which 
Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder. 
1[108A. Abetment in India of offences outside India.—A person abets an offence within the 
meaning of this Code who, in 2[India], abets the commission of any act without and beyond 2[India] 
which would constitute an offence if committed in 2[India]. 
Illustration 
A, in 2[India], instigates B, a foreigner in Goa, to commit a murder in Goa, A is guilty of abetting murder.] 
109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no 
express provision is made for its punishment.—Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is 
committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the 
punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. 
Explanation.—An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment, when it is 
committed in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or with the aid which 
constitutes the abetment.

1. Added by Act 4 of 1898, s. 3. 
2. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A.O. 1948, the A.O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch., 
to read as above.

(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting 
that offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B. 
(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order that he 
may administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A's absence and thereby causes Z's 
death. Here B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder. 
110. Punishment of abetment if person abetted does act with different intention from that of 
abettor.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the act with a 
different intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for 
the offence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge 
of the abettor and with no other. 
111. Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done.—When an Act is abetted 
and a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent 
as if he had directly abetted it: 
Provided the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was committed under the 
influence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the 
abetment. 
Illustrations 
(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose. The 
child, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of Y, which is by the 
side of that of Z. Here, if the child was acting under the influence of A's instigation, and the act done was 
under the circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable in the same manner and to 
the same extent as if he had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of Y. 
(b) A instigates B to burn Z’s house. B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of 
property there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for 
the theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of the burning. 
(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and 
provides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of 
the inmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to 
the punishment provided for murder. 
112. Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done.—If the act 
for which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is committed in addition to the act abetted, 
and constitute a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences. 
Illustration 
A instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence, resists that distress. In offering the 
resistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the officer executing the distress. As B has committed both the offence of 
resisting the distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and, 
if A knew that B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for each 
of the offences. 
113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different from that intended by 
the abettor.—When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular 
effect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a different effect 
from that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, in the same manner and to the 
same extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the 
act abetted was likely to cause that effect. 
Illustration 
A instigates B to cause grievous hurt to Z. B, in consequence of the instigation, causes grievous hurt to Z. Z dies in 
consequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the 
punishment provided for murder. 
114. Abettor present when offence is committed.—Whenever any person, who is absent would be 
liable to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable in 
consequence of the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence. 

34 
 
115. Abetment of offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life.—if offence not 
committed.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with death or 1[imprisonment for 
life], shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is 
made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with imprisonment of either 
description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine; 
if act causing harm be done in consequence.—and if any act for which the abettor is liable in 
consequence of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable to 
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall also be liable 
to fine. 
Illustration 
A instigates B to murder Z. The offence is not committed. If B had murdered Z, he would have been subject to the 
punishment of death or 1[imprisonment for life]. Therefore A is liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven 
years and also to a fine; and if any hurt be done to Z in consequence of the abetment, he will be liable to imprisonment for a term 
which may extend to fourteen years, and to fine. 
116. Abetment of offence punishable with imprisonment—if offence be not committed.—
Whoever abets an offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence be not committed in 
consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such 
abetment, be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence for a term which 
may extend to one-fourth part of the longest term provided for that offence; or with such fine as is 
provided for that offence, or with both; 
if abettor or person abetted be a public servant whose duty it is to prevent offence.—and if the 
abettor or the person abetted is a public servant, whose duty it is to prevent the commission of such 
offence, the abettor shall be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence, for 
a term which may extend to one-half of the longest term provided for that offence, or with such fine as is 
provided for the offence, or with both. 
Illustrations 
(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing. A some favour in the exercise of B's official functions. B

robbery be not committed, B is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for the offence of robbery, and 
also to fine. 
117. Abetting commission of offence by the public or by more than ten persons.—Whoever abets 
the commission of an offence by the public generally or by any number or class of persons exceeding ten, 
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or 
with fine, or with both. 
Illustration 
A affixes in a public place a placard instigating a sect consisting of more than ten members to meet at a certain time and

punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, or, if the 
offence be not committed, with imprisonment of either description, for a term which may extend to three 
years; and in either case shall also be liable to fine. 
Illustration 
A, knowing that dacoity is about to be committed at B, falsely informs the Magistrate that a dacoity is about to be committed 
at C, a place in an opposite direction, and thereby misleads the Magistrate with intent to facilitate the commission of the offence. 
The dacoity is committed at B in pursuance of the design. A is punishable under this section. 
119. Public servant concealing design to commit offence which it is his duty to prevent.—
Whoever, being a public servant intending to facilitate or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby 
facilitate the commission of an offence which it is his duty as such public servant to prevent, 
1[voluntarily conceals, by any act or illegal omission or by the use of encryption or any other 
information hiding tool, the existence of a design] to commit such offence, or makes any representation

2[imprisonment for life], with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten 
years; 
if offence be not committed.—or, if the offence be not committed, shall be punished with 
imprisonment of any description provided for the offence for a term which may extend to one-fourth part 
of the longest term of such imprisonment or with such fine as is provided for the offence, or with both. 
Illustration 
A, an officer of police, being legally bound to give information of all designs to commit robbery which may come to his 
knowledge, and knowing that B designs to commit robbery, omits to give such information, with intent to facilitate the 
commission of that offence. Here A has by an illegal omission concealed the existence of B's design, and is liable to punishment 
according to the provision of this section. 
120. Concealing design to commit offence punishable with imprisonment.—Whoever, intending 
to facilitate or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby facilitate the commission of an offence 
punishable with imprisonment,

CHAPTER XI 
OF FALSE EVIDENCEAND OFFENCES AGAINST PUBLIC JUSTICE 
191. Giving false evidence.—Whoever, being legally bound by an oath or by an express provision of 
law to state the truth, or being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject, makes any statement 
which is false, and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, is said to 
give false evidence. 
Explanation1.—A statement is within the meaning of this section, whether it is made verbally or 
otherwise. 
Explanation 2.—A false statement as to the belief of the person attesting is within the meaning of this 
section, and a person may be guilty of giving false evidence by stating that he believes a thing which he 
does not believe, as well as by stating that he knows a thing which he does not know. 
Illustrations 
(a) A, in support of a just claim which B has against Z for one thousand rupees, falsely swears on a trial that he heard Z 
admit the justice of B's claim. A has given false evidence. 
(b) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of Z, when 
he does not believe it to be the handwriting of Z. Here A states that which he knows to be false, and therefore gives false 
evidence. 
(c) A, knowing the general character of Z's handwriting, states that he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of 
Z; A in good faith believing it to be so. Here A's statement is merely as to his belief, and is true as to his belief, and therefore, 
although the signature may not be the handwriting of Z, A has not given false evidence. 
(d) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he knows that Z was at a particular place on a particular day, not 
knowing anything upon the subject. A gives false evidence whether Z was at that place on the day named or not.

51 
 
in a judicial proceeding, or in a proceeding taken by law before a public servant as such, or before an 
arbitrator, and that such circumstance, false entry or false statement, so appearing in evidence, may cause 
any person who in such proceeding is to form an opinion upon the evidence, to entertain an erroneous 
opinion touching any point material to the result of such proceeding is said “to fabricate false evidence”. 
Illustrations 
(a) A puts jewels into a box belonging to Z, with the intention that they may be found in that box, and that this circumstance 
may cause Z to be convicted of theft. A has fabricated false evidence. 
(b) A makes a false entry in his shop-book for the purpose of using it as corroborative evidence in a Court of Justice. A has 
fabricated false evidence. 
(c) A, with the intention of causing Z to be convicted of a criminal conspiracy, writes a letter in imitation of Z's handwriting, 
purporting to be addressed to an accomplice in such criminal conspiracy, and puts the letter in a place which he knows that the 
officers of the police are likely to search. A has fabricated false evidence. 
193. Punishment for false evidence.—Whoever intentionally gives false evidence in any of a 
judicial proceeding, or fabricates false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial 
proceeding, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to

Justice, is a stage of a judicial proceeding, though that investigation may not take place before a Court of 
Justice. 
Illustration 
A, in an enquiry before a Magistrate for the purpose of ascertaining whether Z ought to be committed for trial, makes on 
oath a statement which he knows to be false. As this enquiry is a stage of a judicial proceeding, A as given false evidence. 
Explanation 3.—An investigation directed by a Court of Justice according to law, and conducted 
under the authority of a Court of Justice, is a stage of a judicial proceeding, though that investigation may 
not take place before a Court of Justice. 
Illustration 
A, in an enquiry before an officer deputed by a Court of Justice to ascertain on the spot the boundaries of land, makes on 
oath a statement which he knows to be false. As this enquiry is a stage of a judicial proceeding, A has given false evidence. 
194. Giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure conviction of capital offence.—

CHAPTER XVI 
OF OFFENCESAFFECTINGTHE HUMAN BODY 
Of offences affecting life 
299. Culpable homicide.—Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing 
death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the 
knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide. 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
1. Ins. by Act 25 of 1927, s. 2.

4. Subs. by s. 3, ibid., for “two years”. 

70 
 
Illustrations 
(a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that death is likely to 
be thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable 
homicide. 
(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death, 
induces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable 
homicide. 
(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. 
Here, although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause 
death by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death. 
Explanation 1.—A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, 
disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused 
his death. 
Explanation 2.—Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury 
shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment 
the death might have been prevented. 
Explanation 3.—The causing of the death of a child in the mother's womb is not homicide. But it may 
amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought 
forth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born. 
300. Murder.—Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by 
which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or— 
2ndly.—If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be 
likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or— 
3rdly.—If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury 
intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or— 
4thly.—If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all 
probability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without 
any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid. 
Illustrations 
(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. 
(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention 
of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been 
sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is 
labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of 
health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such 
bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. 
(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. 
Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death. 
(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, 
although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. 
Exception 1.—When culpable homicide is not murder.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the 
offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death 
of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. 
The above exception is subject to the following provisos:— 
First.—That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for 
killing or doing harm to any person. 
Secondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public 
servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. 
Thirdly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of 
private defence. 

71 
 
Explanation.—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from 
amounting to murder is a question of fact. 
Illustrations 
(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, 
inasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in 
doing an act caused by the provocation. 
(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing 
himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable 
homicide. 
(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, 
inasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. 
(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has 
perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. 
(e)A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. 
A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by 
a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. 
(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and 
to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only 
culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. 
Exception 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the 
right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the 
death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and 
without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. 
Illustration 
Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the 
assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has 
not committed murder, but only culpable homicide. 
Exception 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a 
public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and 
causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due 
discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is 
caused. 
Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden 
fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender's having taken undue 
advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. 
Explanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first 
assault. 
Exception 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above 
the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. 
Illustration 
A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's 
youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder. 
301. Culpable homicide by causing death of person other than person whose death was 
intended.—If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, 
commits culpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he neither intends nor knows 
himself to be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of 
which it would have been if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended or knew 
himself to he likely to cause. 
 
 

72 
 
302. Punishment for murder.—Whoever commits murder shall be punished with death or 
1[imprisonment for life], and shall also be liable to fine. 
303. Punishment for murder by life-convict.—Whoever, being under sentence of 1[imprisonment 
for life], commits murder, shall be punished with death.

homicide not amounting to murder, shall be punished with 1[imprisonment for life], or imprisonment of 
either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by 
which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as 
is likely to cause death; 
or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, or 
with both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention 
to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. 
2[304A. Causing death by negligence.—Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash 
or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either 
description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.] 
3[304B. Dowry death.—(1) Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or 
occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that 
soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her 
husband for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called “dowry death”, and 
such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death. 
Explanation.—For the purposes of this sub-section, “dowry” shall have the same meaning as in 
section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (28 of 1961). 
(2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be 
less than seven years but which may extend to imprisonment for life.] 
305. Abetment of suicide of child or insane person.—If any person under eighteen years of age, 
any insane person, any delirious person, any idiot, or any person in a state of intoxication, commits

imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to 
fine; and if hurt is caused to any person by such act, the offender shall be liable either to 1[imprisonment 
for life], or to such punishment as is hereinbefore mentioned. 
Attempts by life-convicts.—4[When any person offending under this section is under sentence of 
1[imprisonment for life], he may, if hurt is caused, be punished with death.] 
Illustrations

liable to punishment under this section. 
(b) A, with the intention of causing the death of a child of tender years, exposes it in a desert place A has committed the 
offence defined by this section, though the death of the child does not ensue.

cessation of motion as brings that substance into contact with any part of that other's body, or with 
anything which that other is wearing or carrying, or with anything so situated that such contact affects that 
other's sense of feeling: Provided that the person causing the motion, or change of motion, or cessation of 
motion, causes that motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion in one of the three ways hereinafter 
described: 
First.—By his own bodily power. 
Secondly.—By disposing any substance in such a manner that the motion or change or cessation of 
motion takes place without any further act on his part, or on the part of any other person.

force is used, is said to use criminal force to that other. 
Illustrations 
(a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes the boat to drift down the 
stream. Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is 
produced without any other action on any person's part. A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so 

79 
 
without Z's consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will 
cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z. 
(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z's horses, and thereby causes them to quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of 
motion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z's 
consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z. 
(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of 
motion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, 
without Z's consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z. 
(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his own person so as to bring 
it into contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z's consent, intending or 
knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z. 
(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z's 
clothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z's clothes or something carried 
by Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z's clothes, A 
has used force to Z, and if he did so without Z's consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal 
force to Z. 
(f) A intentionally pulls up a Woman's veil. Here A intentionally uses force to her, and if he does so without her consent 
intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her. 
(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A intentionally by his own bodily power 
causes such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact 
must affect Z's sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this without Z's consent 
intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force. 
(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z's consent. Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses 
criminal force to Z. 
351. Assault.—Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely 
that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that 
gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault. 
Explanation.—Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give 
to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an 
assault. 
Illustrations 
(a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to strike 
Z. A has committed an assault. 
(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to 
believe that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A has committed an assault upon Z. 
(c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, “I will give you a beating”. Here, though the words used by A could in no case amount to 
an assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied by any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault,the gesture 
explained by the words may amount to an assault. 
352. Punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation.—Whoever 
assaults or uses criminal force to any person otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation given by 
that person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 
three months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both.

dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A. 
(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may 
dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. 
                                                           
1. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). 

89 
 
(d) A being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's 
consent. A has committed theft. 
(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a 
goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has 
not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. 
(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A 
dishonestly removes it, A commits theft. 
(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he 
may commit criminal misappropriation of property. 
(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear 
of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the 
intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the 
ring, commits theft. 
(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for 
which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, 
and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as 
what he did was not done dishonestly.  
(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes 
the watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, 
inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. 
(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he 
borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. 
(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he 
obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. 
(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express 
consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived 
that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft. 
(n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it 
is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed 
theft. 
(o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such 
property as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. 
(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of B's possession. 
Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. 
379. Punishment for theft.—Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either 
description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. 
380. Theft in dwelling house, etc.—Whoever commits theft in any building, tent or vessel, which

382. Theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint in order to the 
committing of the theft.—Whoever commits theft, having made preparation for causing death, or hurt, 
or restraint, or fear of death, or of hurt, or of restraint, to any person, in order to the committing of such 
theft, or in order to the effecting of his escape after the committing of such theft, or in order to the 
retaining of property taken by such theft, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which 
may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.

valuable security or anything signed or sealed which may be converted into a valuable security, commits 
“extortion”. 
Illustrations

A has committed extortion. 
(b) A threatens Z that he will keep Z's child in wrongful confinement, unless Z will sign and deliver to A a promissory note 
binding Z to pay certain monies to A. Z sings and delivers the note. A has committed extortion. 
(c) A threatens to send club-men to plough up Z's field unless Z will sign and deliver to B a bond binding Z under a penalty 
to deliver certain produce to B, and thereby induces Z to sign and deliver the bond. A has committed extortion. 
(d) A, by putting Z in fear of grievous hurt, dishonestly induces Z to sign or affix his seal to a blank paper and deliver it to 
A. Z sings and delivers the paper to A. Here, as the paper so signed may be converted into a valuable security. A has committed 
extortion. 
384. Punishment for extortion.—Whoever commits extortion shall be punished with imprisonment 
of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. 
385. Putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion.—Whoever, in order to the

91 
 
offender, for that end voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful 
restraint, or fear of instant death or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint. 
When extortion is robbery.—Extortion is “robbery” if the offender, at the time of committing the 
extortion, is in the presence of the person put in fear, and commits the extortion by putting that person in 
fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint to that person or to some other person, 
and, by so putting in fear, induces the person so put in fear then and there to deliver up the thing extorted. 
Explanation.—The offender is said to be present if he is sufficiently near to put the other person in 
fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint. 
Illustrations 
(a) A holds Z down, and fraudulently takes Z's money and jewels from Z's clothes, without Z's consent. Here A has 
committed theft, and, in order to the committing of that theft, has voluntarily caused wrongful restraint to Z. A has therefore 
committed robbery. 
(b) A meets Z on the high road, shows a pistol, and demands Z's purse. Z, in consequence, surrenders his purse. Here A has 
extorted the purse from Z by putting him in fear of instant hurt, and being at the time of committing the extortion in his presence. 
A has therefore committed robbery. 
(c) A meets Z and Z's child on the high road. A takes the child, and threatens to filing it down a precipice, unless Z delivers 
his purse. Z, in consequence, delivers his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z, by causing Z to be in fear of instant hurt to 
the child who is there present. A has therefore committed robbery on Z. 
(d) A obtains property from Z by saying “Your child is in the hands of my gang, and will be put to death unless you send us 
ten thousand rupees”. This is extortion, and punishable as such: but it is not robbery, unless Z is put in fear of the instant death of 
his child.

term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. 
Illustrations 
(a) A takes property belonging to Z out of Z's possession, in good faith believing at the time when he takes it, that the 
property belongs to himself. A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property 
to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section. 
(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express 
consent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had Z's implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has 
not committed theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section. 
(c) A and B, being, joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B's possession, intending to use it. Here, as A has a right 
to use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it. But, if A sells the horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his 
own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section. 
Explanation 1.—A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation with the meaning 
of this section. 
Illustration 
A finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement. A, knowing that the note belongs to Z, 
pledges it with a banker as a security or a loan, intending at a future time to restore it to Z. A has committed an offence under this 
section. 
Explanation 2.—A person who finds property not in the possession of any other person, and takes 
such property for the purpose of protecting it for, or of restoring it to, the owner, does not take or 
misappropriate it dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence; but he is guilty of the offence above defined, 
if he appropriates it to his own use, when he knows or has the means of discovering the owner, or before 
he has used reasonable means to discover and give notice to the owner and has kept the property a 
reasonable time to enable the owner to claim it. 
What are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question of fact. 
It is not necessary that the finder should know who is the owner of the property, or that any particular 
person is the owner of it; it is sufficient if, at the time of appropriating it, he does not believe it to be his 
own property, or in good faith believe that the real owner cannot be found. 
Illustrations 
(a) A finds a rupee on the high road, not knowing to whom the rupee belongs, A picks up the rupee. Here A has not 
committed the offence defined in this section.

93 
 
(b) A finds a letter on the road, containing a bank note. From the direction and contents of the letter he learns to whom the 
note belongs. He appropriates the note. He is guilty of an offence under this section. 
(c) A finds a cheque payable to bearer. He can form no conjecture as to the person who has lost the cheque. But the name of 
the person, who has drawn the cheque, appears. A knows that this person can direct him to the person in whose favour the cheque 
was drawn. A appropriates the cheque without attempting to discover the owner. He is guilty of an offence under this section. 
(d) A sees Z drop his purse with money in it. A picks up the purse with the intention of restoring it to Z, but afterwards 
appropriates it to his own use. A has committed an offence under this section. 
(e) A finds a purse with money, not knowing to whom it belongs; he afterwards discovers that it belongs to Z, and 
appropriates it to his own use. A is guilty of an offence under this section. 
(f) A finds a valuable ring, not knowing to whom it belongs. A sells it immediately without attempting to discover the 
owner. A is guilty of an offence under this section. 
404. Dishonest misappropriation of property possessed by deceased person at the time of his 
death.—Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use property, knowing that such 
property was in the possession of a deceased person at the time of that person's decease, and has not since 
been in the possession of any person legally entitled to such possession, shall be punished with 
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to 
fine, and if the offender at the time of such person's decease was employed by him as a clerk or servant, 
the imprisonment may extend to seven years. 
Illustration

dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in 
which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made 
touching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do, commits “criminal 
breach of trust”.

(c) A, residing in Calcutta, is agent for Z, residing at Delhi. There is an express or implied contract between A and Z, that all 
sums remitted by Z to A shall be invested by A, according to Z's direction. Z remits a lakh of rupees to A, with directions to A to 
invest the same in Company's paper. A dishonestly disobeys the directions and employs the money in his own business. A has 
committed criminal breach of trust. 
(d) But if A, in the last illustration, not dishonestly but in good faith, believing that it will be more for Z's advantage to hold 
shares in the Bank of Bengal, disobeys Z's directions, and buys shares in the Bank of Bengal, for Z, instead of buying Company's 
paper, here, thought Z should suffer loss, and should be entitled to bring a civil action against A, on account of that loss, yet A, 
not having acted dishonestly, has not committed criminal breach of trust.

to Z or his order” and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words “Pay to Z or his order”, and thereby converts the 
special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery. 
(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same 
estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the 
estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery. 
(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has 
prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery. 
(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B's name without B's authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in 
distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. 
Here, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery. 
(k) A without B's authority writes a letter and signs it in B's name certifying to A's character, intending thereby to obtain 
employment under Z. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to 
induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract for service. 
Explanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery. 
Illustrations 
(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person 
of the same name. A has committed forgery. 
(b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z's name, in order that B may afterwards write on the 
paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; 
and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B is also guilty of forgery. 
(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own 
name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed 
forgery. 
(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, 
executes a lease of the estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with 
intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in 
his own name, commits forgery by antedating it. 
(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A's benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; 
and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, 
and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has 
committed forgery under the first head of the definition. 
Explanation 2.—The making of a false document in the name of a fictious person, intending it to be 
believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to 
be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery.

Illustration 
A draws a bill of exchange upon a fictious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person with 
intent to negotiate it. A commits forgery.

7.1. PW-1, Sh. Nishant Saluja deposed that on 24.03.2015 at about 7:30 pm, PW-2 Pawan Kakkar
and he were present in the office situated at Tilak Nagar. Two young persons having covered their
faces with a cloth entered into the office. One had a pistol in his hand and another had a big knife.
Both directed to hand over all the cash to them. The boy holding the pistol pointed it towards PW-2
and hit its butt on head of Pawan due to which he received injury on his head. The person holding
the knife attacked him due to which he sustained cut injury on his right thumb. One cartridge had
fallen from pistol and knife also fell from the hand of the offenders. Having seen this, both the
offenders became perplexed. Thereafter, person holding the pistol ran outside the office. The boy
holding the knife also tried to run away from the office. However, PW-1 and PW-2 gathered the
courage and apprehended the boy who had the knife. His identity was revealed as accused Adatiya.
When the offenders were trying State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015

11. During the trial, Sh. S.P Sharma, Ld. Counsel for accused Peter Joseph also made a statement
thereby not disputing the identity of vehicle bearing registration no. DL 9CG 7012.
The statement of accused persons u/s 313 Cr.P.C:
12. The statements of accused persons Yakub, Adatiya @ Akash and Peter u/s 313 Cr.P.C were
recorded. The incriminating circumstances appearing in evidence against the accused were brought
to their notice and their explanations were sought. Accused persons wished to lead defence
evidence.
Defence Evidence:
13. In defence, accused got examined three witnesses. Accused Peter examined Sh. Victor Joseph as
DW-1. Accused Yakub and Adatiya @ Akash examined themselves as DW-2 (though DW-2 should
be DW-3) after their application u/s 315 Cr.P.C were allowed.
14. The Ld. Prosecutor and the Ld. Counsel for the accused persons advanced the final arguments.
Submissions by Ld. Prosecutor:
15. Ld. Prosecutor while relying upon the oral and documentary evidence on the record argued that
the prosecution has been able to prove the case against the accused persons beyond reasonable
doubt. He further emphasized the testimonies State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR
No. 519/2015 11/36 of PW-1 and PW-2. He further argued that there is no motive on the part of
PW-1 and PW-2 to falsely implicate the accused persons in the offence. He further argued that knife
and a cartridge were recovered at the spot and that accused Adatiya @ Akash was also apprehended
at the spot.
Submissions by Ld. Counsel for accused persons :
16. On the other hand Ld counsel for accused persons argued that the prosecution has miserably
failed to prove the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. They further argued that one
of the main eye witness PW-4 Guru Kirpal Singh has turned hospital and did not support the
prosecution. Moreover, the knife allegedly recovered from the spot was also not sent to the FSL.
They further argued that the IO has failed to obtain finger prints from the spot. They further argued
that accused Peter and Yakub refused to participate in the judicial TIP as they were already shown
by the IO to the concerned witnesses. They further argued that despite the presence of CCTV
cameras near the spot, the IO has failed to file the same on record which effects the credibility of the
prosecution case at a great length. They further argued that IO has also failed to file on record the
CDR of Yakub to show that he was present at the spot at the relevant time.
Analysis:

17. It is settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that the prosecution has to prove the case against
the accused beyond reasonable doubt and the accused has to prove its defence on State Vs Mohd.
Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 12/36 preponderance of probabilities. What do
we mean by the expression 'beyond reasonable doubt'?
18. For our good fortune, the said expression has been defined by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
various judgments. In the judgment of Paramjeet Singh @ Pamma Vs. State of Uttarakhand,
2011CRI.L.J.663, Hon'ble Mr. Justice Dr. B. S. Chauhan, elaborated the concept of Standard of
Proof in a criminal trial in the following terms:
"11. A criminal trial is not a fairy tale wherein one is free to give flight to one's
imagination or fantasy. Crime is an event in real life and is the product of an interplay
between different human emotions. In arriving at a conclusion about the guilt of the
accused charged with commission of a crime, the court has to judge the evidence by
the yardstick of probabilities, intrinsic worth and the animus of witnesses. Every
case, in the final analysis, would have to depend upon its own facts. The court must
bear in mind that "human nature is too willing, when faced with brutal crimes, to
spin stories out of strong suspicions." Though an offence may be gruesome and revolt
the human conscience, an accused can be convicted only on legal evidence and not on
surmises and conjecture. The law does not permit the court to punish the accused on
the basis of a moral conviction or suspicion alone. "The burden of proof in a criminal
trial never shifts and it is always the burden of the prosecution to prove its case
beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of acceptable evidence." In fact, it is a settled
principle of criminal jurisprudence that the more serious the offence, the stricter the
degree of proof required, since a higher degree of assurance is required to convict the
accused. The fact that the offence was committed in a very cruel and revolting
manner may in itself be a reason for scrutinizing the evidence more closely, lest the
shocking nature of the crime induce an instinctive reaction against dispassionate
judicial scrutiny of the facts and law. (Vide: Kashmira Singh Vs. State of Madhya
Pradesh, AIR 1952 SC 159; State of Punjab Vs. Jagir Singh Baljit Singh & Anr. AIR
1973 SC 2407; Shankarlal Gyarasilal Dixit Vs. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1981 SC 765;
Mousam Singha Roy & Ors. Vs.State of West Bengal, (2003) 12 SCC 377; and Aloke
Nath Dutta & Ors. Vs. State of West Bengal, (2007) 12 SCC 230).
12. In Sarwan Sigh Rattan Singh Vs. State of Punjab, AIR 1957 SC 637, this court
observed (Para12) :
State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 13/36
"Considered as a whole the prosecution story may be true; but between 'may be true'
and 'must be true' there is inevitably a long distance to travel and the whole of this
distance must be covered by legal, reliable and unimpeachable evidence (before an
accused can be convicted."

19. Furthermore, in the judgment of Sucha Singh and Another Vs. State of Punjab, (2003 ) 7 SCC
643, the Hon'ble Supreme Court explained the term Beyond Reasonable Doubt and observed as
under:-
21. Exaggerated devotion to the rule of benefit of doubt must not nurture fanciful
doubts or lingering suspicion and thereby destroy social defence. Justice cannot be
made sterile on the plea that it is better to let hundred guilty escape than punish an
innocent. Letting guilty escape is not doing justice according to law. [See Gurbachan
Singh v.
Satpal Singh and others, AIR 1990 SC 209 : 1990(1) RCR(Crl.) 297 (SC)]. Prosecution is not
required to meet any and every hypothesis put forward by the accused. [See State of U.P. v. Ashok
Kumar Srivastava, AIR 1992 SC 840 :
1992(3) RCR(Crl.) 63 (SC)]. A reasonable doubt is not an imaginary, trivial or merely
possible doubt, but a fair doubt based upon reason and common sense. It must grow
out of the evidence in the case. If a case is proved perfectly, it is argued that it is
artificial; if a case has some flaws inevitable because human beings are prone to err, it
is argued that it is too imperfect. One wonders whether in the meticulous
hypersensitivity to eliminate a rare innocent from being punished, many guilty
persons must be allowed to escape. Proof beyond reasonable doubt is a guideline, not
a fetish. [See Inder Singh and Anr. v. State of (Delhi Admn.) (AIR 1978 SC 1091)].
Vague hunches cannot take place of judicial evaluation. "A judge does not preside
over a criminal trial, merely to see that no innocent man is punished. A judge also
presides to see that a guilty man does not escape. Both are public duties." (Per
Viscount Simon in Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecution (1944 AC (PC)
315) quoted in State of U.P. v. Anil Singh, AIR 1988 SC 1998). Doubts would be called
reasonable if they are free from a zest for abstract speculation. Law cannot afford any
favourite other than truth.
20. The accused persons have been charged for the offences u/s 393/394/397/398 IPC.
State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 14/36
21. Section 393 IPC reads as under:-
"Attempt to commit robbery- Whoever attempts to commit robbery shall be punished
with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall
also be liable to fine."
22. Section 394 IPC reads as under:-
State vs Mohd. Yakub Etc on 29 March, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20389847/
9

"Voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery- If any person, in committing or in
attempting to commit robbery, voluntarily causes hurt, such person, and any other
person jointly concerned in committing or attempting to commit such robbery, shall
be punished with imprisonment for life, or with rigorous imprisonment for a term
which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine."
23. Section 397 reads as under:-
"397. Robbery, or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt.--
If, at the time of committing robbery or dacoity, the offender uses any deadly
weapon, or causes grievous hurt to any person, or attempts to cause death or grievous
hurt to any person, the imprisonment with which such offender shall be punished
shall not be less than seven years."
24. In the judgment of Dilawar Singh v. State of Delhi, (2007) 12 SCC 641, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court stated the essential ingredients of section 397 in the following manner:
"19. The essential ingredients of Section 397 IPC are as follows:
1. The accused committed robbery.
2. While committing robbery or dacoity (i) the accused used deadly weapon (ii) to
cause grievous hurt to any person (iii) attempted to cause death or grievous hurt to
any person.
3. "Offender" refers to only culprit who actually used deadly weapon. When only one
has used the deadly weapon, others cannot be awarded the minimum punishment. It
only envisages the State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No.
519/2015 15/36 individual liability and not any constructive liability.
Section 397 IPC is attracted only against the particular accused who uses the deadly weapon or does
any of the acts mentioned in the provision. But the other accused are not vicariously liable under
that section for acts of the co-accused."
25. Section 398 IPC reads as under:-
"398. Attempt to commit robbery or dacoity when armed with deadly weapon.--
If, at the time of attempting to commit robbery or dacoity, the offender is armed with
any deadly weapon, the imprisonment with which such offender shall be punished
shall not be less than seven years."

26. Section 398 IPC is applicable when at the time of attempting to6 commit robbery or dacoity, the
offender is armed with any deadly weapon.
27. Section 393 IPC is an attempt to commit robbery. Section 394 IPC is applicable in two situations.
First is when any person in committing or attempting to commit robbery voluntarily causes hurt,
then such person is liable u/s 394 IPC. The second situation is that when any person while
committing or attempting to commit robbery voluntarily causes hurt then such person and any
other person jointly concerned in commission or attempt to commit robbery become liable. Section
390 IPC defines robbery. It provides that when the hurt is caused in order to committing of the theft
or in committing the theft or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the
theft, the offender causes the offence of robbery. The basic difference u/s 390 IPC (punishing
section 392 IPC) and 394 IPC is that the hurt u/s 392 IPC is caused with a view of commit robbery
wherein u/s 394 IPC, the hurt is not necessary to commit theft. This can be understood by the use of
words 'for that end' in Section 390 IPC.
State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 16/36 Moreover, Section 392
IPC is applicable in a case of complete robbery and is not applicable where the robbery falls short of
completion and in other words there was only an attempt.
28. Section 397 IPC is applicable when at the time of committing robbery or dacoity, the offender
uses any deadly weapon or causes grievous hurt to any person or attempts to cause death or
grievous hurt to any person. It applies to the offender who uses the deadly weapon in commission of
the offence. It is settled law that the word 'use' does not mean that the weapon must have been
actually used. The word 'use' denotes that if the weapon is within the sight of the victim and was
capable of causing terror in his mind, then the offender can be said to have used the weapon. For
example, if the offender has hidden a pistol underneath the belt of his pants covered by the shirt not
tucked up into the pants and the offender shows the pistol by lifting the shirt in order to show the
pistol to the victim, the weapon can be said to have been used for the purpose of Section 397 IPC.
Furthermore, Section 397 is applicable to the situation where the offence of robbery is complete.
29. Section 398 IPC is applicable to the situation where the offender does not use the weapon but is
armed with any deadly weapon. Thus, the stark difference between Section 397 IPC and 398 IPC is
that u/s 397 IPC, the weapon must have been used but for the purpose of Section 398 IPC, it is not
necessary that the weapon must be used but it is sufficient if the offender is armed with deadly
weapon. Section 398 IPC is applicable where the offence of robbery or dacoity is not complete and
there remains an attempt only whereas S. 397 applies to a complete robbery.
State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 17/36
30. It is further settled that Section 397 and 398 IPC are not substantive offences but they only
regulate the punishment. In addition to that, it can be said that Section 392 IPC corresponds to
Section 397 IPC whereas Section 393 IPC corresponds to Section 398 IPC.

31. Before deciding the question whether the prosecution has been able to prove the case against the
accused beyond reasonable doubt or not, the court is of the opinion that the contentions of the
accused be dealt first.
Absence of independent public person:-
32. The first argument of Ld. Counsel for the accused persons was that no independent public
witness has been joined by the IO in the investigation and that the alleged independent public
witness, namely, PW-4 Guru Kirpal Singh did not support the prosecution case. Aforesaid
contention of the Ld. Counsel are in two parts, first is that no independent public witness has been
joined in the investigation which on the face of it is incorrect as PW-4 Guru Kirpal Singh is an
independent public witness who as per the case of the prosecution was a neighbour. The second part
of the contention was that PW-4 Guru Kirpal did not support the prosecution case. The court is not
in the agreement with the aforesaid submissions of the accused that no independent public person
has been examined which is clear from the fact that PW-4 is an independent witness.
33. A careful perusal of the testimony of PW-4 shows that he has supported the prosecution case as
far as the incident is concerned. He has deposed that on 24.03.2015, i.e. the date of State Vs Mohd.
Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 18/36 incident at about 7 or 7:30 pm when he
was at his shop, he heard some noise coming from the adjacent shop of Nishant. When he came out,
he saw that Nishant and his employee had caught hold of a person. One of the employees of Nishant
was bleeding from his head. Although he could not identify the said person, who was apprehended
by Nishant and his employee. The witness could not identify him in the court despite having a
glance over the persons present in the court, stating that he was unable to identify. He further
deposed that he came to know from the owner of the Nishant's shop that two persons had probably
entered into the said shop to commit robbery and out of which, one had fled away and the person
who had been caught was having a butcher's knife in his hand. He made a call to the SHO of local
police station from his mobile phone and police reached at the spot and had taken the assailant. He
further deposed that he had seen a bullet which was recovered from the assailant.
In the cross-examination, he stated that a bullet and knife were not subjected to police proceedings
in his presence and he had not noticed any crime team inspecting the crime scene. He further stated
that he was never called to participate in the TIP proceedings. He denied the suggestion that he
being neighbour of Nishant was an interested witness.
34. Therefore, the crux of his testimony was in the nature of res gestae. He has not seen the offence
but he has reached at the shop of Nishant so soon after the incident that whatever he has heard and
observed must fall within the definition of res gestae evidence as prescribed u/s 6 of Indian
Evidence Act. Although he did not identify accused Adatiya @ Akash in the court, but he State Vs
Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 19/36 specifically deposed about the
incident and the apprehension of one accused at the shop of Nishant. Thus, the testimony of PW-4
Guru Kirpal cannot be said to be completely hostile against the case of the prosecution. His
testimony definitely can be taken as corroborative piece of evidence to the testimony of PW-1 and
PW-2. Merely that he has failed to identify accused Adatiya @ Akash in the court does not mean that
State vs Mohd. Yakub Etc on 29 March, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20389847/
12

his testimony has turned into the nature of hostile evidence and goes against the prosecution case.
Therefore, this court is unable to accept the submissions of Ld. Counsel and accordingly, the
submissions stand rejected.
35. The next point vehemently raised by the Ld. Defence Counsel is that there are material
contradictions in the testimony of the prosecution witnesses. But here the question which assumes
importance is that what would amount to the material contradictions and what would not. In State
of Rajasthan Vs. Kalki (1981)2 SCC 752 the Hon'ble Supreme Court was pleased to held that as
under:-
"normal discrepancies in evidence are those which are due to normal errors of
observation, normal errors of memory due to lapse of time, due to mental disposition
such as shock and horror at the time of occurrence and those are always there,
however hones and truthful a witness may be. Material discrepancies are those which
are not normal, and not expected of a normal person. Courts have to label the
category to which a discrepancy may be categorized. While normal discrepancies do
not corrode the credibility of a party's case, material discrepancies do so."
36. Therefore, in view of the aforesaid observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Kalki (supra), the law regarding the contradictions and discrepancies are that unless and State Vs
Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 20/36 until the so-called contradictions
and discrepancies in the prosecution are not such that they go to the roots of the prosecution case
creating a reasonable doubt in prosecution story, then the normal discrepancies and contradictions
can be overlooked. The reason being that there may be several reasons for slight deviation, in the
manner of narrating the incident to the police at the early stage, could be caused because of the
limitation of the human memory, the ability to grasp the events minutely and the normal errors of
time. It also depends upon individual to individual as to how he perceives the incident and the role
ascribed to each accused. It is not normal for majority of the human beings who have just being
attacked by the offenders with a purpose to rob them with a deadly weapon such as pistol and knife
and to depose so minutely so as not to allow any minor deviation or discrepancy in the statements.
In view of these observations, if testimony of PW-1 and PW-2 is observed minutely, it reveals that
they both have supported the prosecution case in its material particulars as they both have deposed
about the two masked offenders, one with the knife and another with the pistol and also the manner
in which the incident had been committed with them. They had also correctly identified the accused
persons in the court as well as the case properties. No material contradictions and discrepancies
have been noted by this court in the oral and the documentary evidence prepared in that regard.
37. Although Ld. Counsel for the accused tried to make a mountain out of a molehill by submitting
that in the complaint Ex. PW-1/A, Nishant Saluja stated to police that the person State Vs Mohd.
Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 21/36 standing outside the gate shouted
"Adatiya, Yakub bhago yahan se jaldi" whereas, he deposed that the offenders while trying to run
away from the office were saying "Bhago Yakub". The Ld. Counsel argued that if Yakub was standing
outside the gate, then he could not have shouted his name and as per the statement Ex. PW-1/A, it
appears that accused Peter was standing outside and accused Yakub was in the office along with
State vs Mohd. Yakub Etc on 29 March, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20389847/
13

Adatiya @ Akash otherwise the person standing outside could not have raised the name of accused
Yakub. He argued that thus there is a reasonable doubt about the fact as to who were present in the
office and who was standing outside the gate.
Though the said argument appears to be interesting on its face, however, the cross-examination by
the accused shows that the accused persons have failed to cross-examine the witness PW-1 or
confronted the witness with the aforesaid fact. Hence, once the witness has not been given a chance
to explain the so- called part, therefore, the accused persons could not have raised any doubt about
the veracity of the statement and deposition of the complainant in the court. It is well settled
principle of law that if witness' testimony is to be challenged by a previous statement in writing then
the contention of the witness must be drawn to the said part of the writing and in case of failure
thereto, the testimony of the witness cannot be said to have been properly challenged and the
accused has to be said to have accepted the same. Thus, the court does not find any force in the said
submissions and same are rejected.
State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 22/36 Defects and lapses in
investigation:-
38. Ld. Counsel for accused further argued that the IO did not carry out proper investigation in a
professional manner which render the case of the prosecution doubtful. He particularly emphasized
on not lifting the chance print from the spot as well as the knife allegedly recovered from accused
Adatiya @ Akash was not sent to the FSL.
39. It is well settled principle of criminal law that the defective investigation should not give any
benefit to the accused if the case has otherwise been proved by the testimonies of the eye witnesses.
In Vishveswaran Vs. State (2003)6 SCC 73 in para 12 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as:
"........................It is also required to be kept in view that every defective investigation need not
necessarily result in the acquittal. In defective investigation, the only requirement is of extra caution
by courts while evaluating evidence. It would not be just to acquit the accused solely as a result of
defective investigation. Any deficiency or irregularity in investigation need not necessarily lead to
rejection of the case of the prosecution when it is otherwise proved.
40. In view of the aforesaid propositions of law, it is said that the minor lapses on the part of the IO
in the investigation should not cause any unreasonable doubt in the story of the prosecution and it is
only when prosecution case is suffering from inherent lacuna and embellishments in the
investigation which tents the prosecution story so much so that there is no plausible explanation
and it suffers the reasonable doubt to the extent that the accused cannot be found guilty on the basis
of State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 23/36 lapse in the
investigation. In the considered opinion of this court, the fact that IO did not sent the alleged
recovered knife to the FSL as well as did not take any chance print did not cause any severe damage
to the prosecution case especially, in view of the testimony of PW-1 Nishant and PW-2 Pawan
Kakkar.
State vs Mohd. Yakub Etc on 29 March, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20389847/

41. The next argument raised by the Ld. Counsel for accused persons is that the IO despite the
presence of CCTV camera near the spot has failed to collect the CCTV footage which would have
otherwise shown that no such offence as alleged by PW-1 and PW-2 had been committed by accused.
In this regard, it would be appropriate to discuss the testimony of prosecution witness PW-1
Nishant. In his cross-examination, he stated that the CCTV camera were not installed inside or
outside of his office nor any CCTV camera was installed at the shop of Guru Kirpal. Though he
stated that one CCTV camera was installed at A Daikin AC Showroom. Further, the accused
suggested to IO PW-14 Inspector Rajpal Meena that no CCTV camera was present at the spot which
the IO admitted. The IO further deposed that he did not take the footage of CCTV installed at the
shop of Guru Kirpal as the said CCTV was installed after one shop and the same did not have the
footage of the incident.
42. The accused persons did not file any application during trial or investigation that a neighbouring
shop had the CCTV footage which be directed to be preserved nor the accused summoned any
witness from the said shop. Moreover, there is nothing in the testimonies of PW-1 and PW-2 that
they had any motive for the false implication of the accused persons. Nothing State Vs Mohd. Yakub
& Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 24/36 could be elicit in the cross-examination of PW-1
and PW-2 to that effect. Hence, the court is not in agreement with the contentions of the Ld.
Counsel that no CCTV footage having been filed on the record, gave rise to a reasonable doubt in
their favour. Accordingly, the same stands rejected.
43. Having discussed the different pleas of the accused persons, now let us see if the prosecution has
been able to prove the offences with which accused persons have been charged. To decide the same,
we again have to revert back to the testimonies of PW-1 Nishant and PW-2 Pawan Kakkar. A careful
perusal of their testimonies would show that the accused Adatiya@ Akash and Peter Joseph entered
to their office alongwith knife and pistol respectively. They both have deposed that accused Adatiya
@ Akash caused hurt with a knife on the person of PW-1 Nishant and accused Peter Joseph hit the
butt of the pistol on the head of PW-2 Pawan Kakkar. It is to be seen whether the oral version of
PW-1 and PW-2 find any corroboration from the medical documents on the record or not. The MLC
Ex.PW-11/A of PW-1 Nishant shows that he was brought to the hospital at about 10 p.m on
24.03.2015 where doctor noted superficial incised wound over right thumb. PW-1 Nishant deposed
that when accused Adatiya@ Akash attacked him, he tried to ward off the attack with his hand due
to which he sustained cut injury on his right thumb. Thus, MLC Ex.PW-11/A corroborates the oral
version of PW-1 Nishant.
44. Similarly, MLC Ex.PW-11/B of PW-2 Pawan Kakkar would reveal that he was brought in the
hospital on 24.03.2015 at about 9.45 p.m. Doctor noted CLW over right parietal region of State Vs
Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 25/36 the skull as well as abrasion over
left zygomatic bone. The zygomatic bone is a bone on the cheek of a human being. Thus, the injury
on the MLC of PW-2 also corroborates the version of both the PWs.
45. The Ld. Counsel for accused tried to show from the medical document of the witnesses that the
witnesses were not brought together at the hospital. They pointed out that as per the MLC
Ex.PW-11/B, the time of arrival of PW-2 was shown as 9.45 p.m whereas as per the MLC
State vs Mohd. Yakub Etc on 29 March, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20389847/
15

Ex.PW-11/A of PW-1, the time of arrival was shown as 10 p.m. However, this court is not willing to
accept the contentions of the Ld. Counsel for the reasons, firstly that the serial number of MLC
Ex.PW-11/B is 399 whereas the serial number of MLC Ex.PW-11/A is 4000. Thus, the record implies
that MLC of PW-2 was firstly made and doctor then examined PW-1. Merely that doctor had noted
different time on the MLC, does not lead the inference that both the persons were not brought
together in the hospital. It is quite possible that the concerned doctor after having prepared his MLC
noted down the time of 10 p.m when he started preparing second MLC. Moreover, no
cross-examination has been conducted on this aspect by the accused persons from PW-11 Dr.
Dhananjay Kumar who proved the MLC. Accordingly, the contention of the accused persons stands
rejected.
46. However, it is also an admitted fact on the record that both the eye witnesses i.e. PW-1 and PW-2
did not depose specifically that any article or money was robbed by the accused persons namely
Peter Joseph and Adatiya @ Akash or something was taken away by them. Thus, the question arises
herein as to what State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 26/36 offence
has been committed by the accused persons. It is clear from the language of Section 392 IPC that it
is only applicable when a robbery has been committed. Section 393 IPC is only an attempt. Section
394 IPC applies into a case where robbery has been committed as well as where there has been only
an attempt to commit robbery when hurt was caused voluntarily by one person and any other
person was jointly concerned in committing or in attempting to commit robbery. Similarly, Section
397 IPC is applicable to a situation where robbery is completed. Further. Section 398 IPC is
applicable to an attempt to commit robbery or dacoity when offender is armed with a deadly
weapon. It is also settled law that sections 397 and 398 IPC are not substantiative offences, but they
merely regulates punishment.
47. Thus, it is clear that in view of the manner of the incident, it is clear that no complete robbery
has been taken place. It was only an attempt by accused persons namely Adatiya@ Akash and Peter
Joseph. It is also clear that accused Adatiya@ Akash and accused Peter Joseph were armed with a
knife and a pistole respectively. The seizure memo Ex.PW-1/D of the knife would show that it has
total length of 32.5 cm with length of the blade as 20 cm and width of blade as 4.5 cm and the
handle of the knife having length as 12.5 cm. The measurement of the knife would show that it was
quite a big knife. The next question which arises here is whether the said knife can be a deadly
weapon or not. It is settled that the knife per se is not a deadly weapon and the use and manner
thereto makes any knife a dangerous weapon. The said knife has been used for the commission of
robbery and injury was caused to injured PW-1 as well and thus, considering State Vs Mohd. Yakub
& Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 27/36 the measurement of the knife, this court is of the
opinion that the knife Ex.P-1 was a deadly weapon.
48. As far as the role of accused Peter Joseph in the alleged commission of offence is concerned,
both the PWs have corroborated each other that accused Peter Joseph hit the but of the pistol on the
head of PW-2 Pawan Kakkar and during the attach a cartridge fell down from the pistol. Though the
Ld. Counsel has argued that the pistol has not been recovered at the spot, but it is a trite law that the
recovery of a deadly weapon or pistol is not necessary and accordingly, the testimonies of PW-1 and
PW-2 are safe to prove that accused Peter had the possession of one pistol out of which one
State vs Mohd. Yakub Etc on 29 March, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20389847/
16

cartridge fell down. This, it can be safely concluded that accused Peter has also the possession of a
deadly weapon i.e. a pistole with him while attempting to commit robbery.
49. Now remains, the role and involvement of accused Mohd. Yakub. Both the witnesses PW-1 and
PW-2 have categorically deposed individually that accused Adatiya@ Akash and accused Peter
Joseph tried to run away from the office and accused Peter Joseph managed to escape from the
offence while shouting for his third companion. The identity of the third companion i.e. Mohd.
Yakub has also been established by the prosecution through the testimonies of PW-1 and PW-2 as
Mohd. Yakub used to come to their office in connection to collect the money received from money
transfer.
50. Thus, the prosecution has been able to prove that while accused Adatiya@ Akash and Peter
Joseph entered into office, accused Yakub remained outside the gate of the office. Hence, it State Vs
Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 28/36 is held that the prosecution has
been able to prove the case against the accused persons for the offence u/s 394/34 IPC as well as u/s
398 IPC individually against accused Adatiya@ Akash and Peter Joseph.
51. Now, let use discuss other charges against accused namely Adatiya@ Akash and Peter. Accused
Adatiya@ Akash has also been charged for the offence u/s 25 & 27 Arms Act, 1959 as he was found
in possession of a knife at the time of commission of robbery. Whether such knife was covered under
the provisions of Section 25 or 27 Arms Act or not, is to be seen. The Governments of NCT of Delhi
under the power conferred in pursuance of the Arms Act, 1959 had issued notification which
regulates that the sale, manufacturing and possession of such knives, is an offence. Vide DAD
notification dated 29.10.1980, the Governments of NCT of Delhi has provided for the regulation
regarding the possession, sealer and manufacturing of the knife. The said notification reads as
under:-
"Case File (25/54/59 Arms Act) (Knife) Notification regarding length and breadth of
Knife DAD Notification (To be Published in Part IV of Deli Gazette) (Extra Ordinary)
Delhi Administration, Delhi Notification Dated the 29th October, 1980 No.
F/13/451/79-Home (G) - Whereas the administration is of the opinion that having
regarding to the circumstances prevailing in the Union Territory of Delhi is necessary
Appointed Date expedient in the public interest, 'to regulate the manufacture sale or
possession for sale or test the spring actuated knives, gararidar knives, bottondar
knives and other knives which open or close with any other mechanical device State
Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 29/36 with a sharp
edge blade of 7.62 Cms, or more in length and 1.72 cms or more in breadth in the
Union Territory of Delhi.
Now, therefore in exercise of the powers under rule 19 of the Arms Rules, 1962 read
with the Govt. of India, Ministry of Home Affairs Notification No. 2/2/69-UTL(ii) dt.
21st June, 1969, the Administrator Delhi is pleased to direct that "no person in the
Union Territory of Delhi shall manufacture, sale or possess for sale or test spring

close with any other mechanical device with a sharp edge blade of 7.62 Cms, or more
in length and 1.72 Cms or more in breadth in the Union Territory of Delhi" unless he
hold a licence issued in accordance with provisions of the Arms Act, 1959 (No. 64 of
1959) and Arms Rule, 1962 framed thereunder with effect from the publication of this
Notification in Delhi Gazette.
Sd/-
(Nathu Ram) Deputy Secretary, Home (G) Delhi, Administration, Delhi No.
F-13/451/179 (Home General) dt. 29.10.1980 This is necessary to be included in the
case file."
(emphasis supplied)"
52. A careful perusal of the aforesaid notification shows that it is applicable only to spring actuated
knives, gararidar knives, buttondar knives as well as other knives. The notification shows that there
are two categories of knives, one is spring actuated knives, gararidar knives, buttondar knives in
which type of knives, the length of blade or total length of knife or breadth of blade is not material
and the second category of knife is that where knife opens or closes with other mechanical device
and also has the requisite length and breadth in accordance with the State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC
No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 30/36 notification. Thus, the length of blade or total length of
knife or breadth of blade is important in second type of knives.
53. Considering the knife recovered in this case, it is seen that the knife recovered in this case is not
a knife which could be open or close with a mechanical device. Thus, though total length of blade,
total length of knife and breadth of blade is covered within the parameters required thereto, but in
view of the fact that the knife recovered in this case was not operated with any mechanical device to
open or close it, did not make the knife to be covered under Arms Act, Thus, the prosecution has
failed to prove the offence u/s 25/27 Arms Act against the accused Adatiya@ Akash as the knife
recovered from his was not covered within the parameters of DAD notification dated 29.10.1980.
54. Now comes the question whether the cartridge recovered at the spot which allegedly fell from the
pistol, held by the Peter is an ammunition or not. As per the case of the prosecution, the pistole was
recovered at the instance of accused Peter from a car parked infornt of H. No. 777, JJ Colony,
Khyala, New Delhi. The said country made pistol was recovered alongwith live cartridge from
underneath of the driving seat of the car. The said pistole alongwith cartridge recovered at the spot
as well as live cartridge were sent to the FSL. The FSL report Ex.AD-2 admitted by accused would
show that the cartridge Mark as Ex.A-1 recovered from the spot was found to be a misfired cartridge.
The FSL report further states that the individual characteristics of fired pin dent mark present on
cartridge Ex.A1 and test fired cartridge from the country made pistol recovered from accused Peter,
State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 31/36 cannot be proved having
fired from the country made pistol by accused Peter. Therefore, the FSL report has failed to prove
that the cartridge recovered at the spot Mark Ex.A-1 had no connection with the pistol recovered
from accused Peter Joseph. Moreover, the cartridge Mark Ex.A-1 is a misfired cartridge.

55. In the judgment of Tehar Vs State of M.P, Misc. CRIMINAL CASE No. 57707 of 2022, dated
13.12.2022, the Hon'ble High Court of MP held that empty cartridge is not an ammunition. While
relying upon the judgment of the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi reported as 2012 (130) DRJ 504 held
that even live cartridge is a minor ammunition. The Hon'ble High Court of MP observed that in view
of the definition of 'ammunition' under section 2(i)(a)(iii) of Arms Act r/w definition of 'cartridge'
under Rule 2 (12) of the Arms Rule, 2016, an empty cartridge is not an ammunition. As per the
definition of the cartridge, the cartridge means a complete object consisting of a cartridge case,
primer, propellant, bullet or any single or multiple projectile. Thus, a mis-fired cartridge is also
clearly not an ammunition. Hence, accused Peter Joseph cannot be convicted for the offence u/s 25
Arms Act for having possession of cartridge Mark Ex.A-1. Accordingly, he stands acquitted for the
offence u/s 25 Arms Act in respect to the empty cartridge recovered at the spot.
56. The next question, which arises is whether accused Peter Joseph could be held liable for the
possession of the country made pistol containing a live cartridge allegedly recovered at his instance
from underneath driving seat of the car.
State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 32/36
57. After having carefully gone through the prosecution evidence in this regard, this court is of the
opinion that the alleged recovery of country made pistol containing one live cartridge at the instance
of accused Peter Joseph from his case is not free from embellishments or doubt. PW-14 IO Inspector
Raj Pal Meena deposed that 25.03.2015 he prepared a raiding party consisting of himself, Ct. Ombir,
Ct. Mahavir Singh and HC Sunil (PW-14, PW-7, PW-9 and PW-13 respectively). The seizure memo
Ex.PW-13/C of the country made pistol containing the live cartridge shows that it was got recovered
by accused Peter Joseph from underneath the driver seat of silver colour Accent Car bearing no.
DL9CG 7012. IO PW-14 Inspector Raj Pal deposed the same as well. However, the other members of
the police team did not corroborate his versions. PW-13 ASI Sunil deposed that the pistol was got
recovered by the accused persons near the driver seat of the car. PW-9 HC Mahavir Singh also
deposed that the pistol was got recovered by the accused persons from near the driver seat of the
car. Thus, there is a reasonable doubt as to the exact place from where the alleged pistol containing
live cartridge was recovered.
58. Moreover, there is also a reasonable doubt about the fact that as to how the silver colour Accent
Car bearing no. DL9CG 7012 was brought to the police station. PW-13 ASI Sunil deposed that he was
not aware as to who brought the said car to the police station. However, PW-9 HC Mahavir Singh
deposed that the said car was brought to the police station by HC Sunil (PW-13). If PW-13 HC Sunil
brought the car to the police station, he would State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR
No. 519/2015 33/36 not have forgotten the same. Thus, a reasonable doubt has crept in the
prosecution story in regard to the aforesaid fact.
59. Another infirmity in the prosecution case in regard to the aforesaid fact is that PW-7 HC Ombir
Singh was also part of the raiding team which recovered the country made pistol containing a live
cartridge and the Accent Car of the accused Peter Joseph. PW-14 IO Inspector Raj Pal deposed that
same. However, PW-9 HC Mahavir Singh and PW-13 ASI Sunil did not depose if Ct. Ombir Singh
State vs Mohd. Yakub Etc on 29 March, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20389847/
19

was also the part of the raiding party on 25.03.215 at the time of recovery of country made pistol and
Accent Car. PW-7 Ct. Ombir Singh himself did not depose anything if he also took part in the
investigation on 25.03.2015. Therefore, a doubt remains if PW-7 Ct. Ombir Singh was involved in
the investigation on 25.03.2015 or not.
60. Another lacunae in the prosecution case which makes the recovery of country made pistol
including a live cartridge as unbelievable is that as per the FSL report Ex.AD-2, the FSL expert
opined that no opinion could be given if the misfired cartridge Ex.A-1 was caused by the country
made pistol recovered from accused Peter Joseph. Thus, the FSL report failed to connect the
misfired cartridge Ex.A-1 with the country made pistol allegedly recovered from the possession of
accused Peter Joseph. Therefore, in the absence of the evidence to connect the alleged pistol with
the misfired cartridge recovered at the spot, the accused Peter Joseph could not have been tried for
the offence u/s 25 Arms Act as well. Hence, accused Peter Joseph stands acquitted from the offence
u/s 25 Arms Act for possession of country made pistol including a live cartridge.
State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 34/36
61. At this stage, it would be appropriate to discuss the defence evidence led by the accused. Peter
Jospeh examined his father Victor Joseph as DW-1 to prove the fact that Peter Joseph was picked up
on 25.03.2015 from his house. The arrest memo Ex.PW-13/A of Peter Joseph shows that he was
arrested on 25.03.2015 at about 10.30 a.m from his house only. The arrest memo shows that his
mother Ms. Anita Joseph was given the information about his arrest. In the cross-examination,
DW-1 admitted that his wife was present in the house on that day. Hence, the testimony of DW-1 did
not yield any favour to the accused rather it provides corroboration to the prosecution case.
62. Accused Mohd. Yakub examined himself. He deposed that on 24.03.2015, he was present at his
house and brought some fruits and vegetables from the market. He gave it to his children. In the
cross-examination, he admitted that he knew Nishant Saluja. He also admitted that prior to the
incident of this case, he had visited the office of the complainant to collect payment of Western
Union money transfer. Thus, he provided corroboration to the prosecution case that he had been
visiting the office of the complainant before the incident as well.
63. Accused Adatiya @ Akash also examined himself as DW. He also admitted his presence on
24.03.2015 at about 7 p.m near the shop of the complainant. He deposed that he alongwith his
brother in law Sandeep were getting the tyre of their car changed and in the meanwhile there was
chaos and accordingly, they reached at the shop of Nishant. Thereafter, because of some confusion,
he was beaten and handed over to the police. Thus, he also admitted his presence at the shop of
complainant Nishant at State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 35/36
the time of the incident.
64. Thus, the defence evidence led by the accused persons would shows that it did not help the
accused persons rather their depositions provided the corroboration to the prosecution case.
Therefore, it is held that the defence evidence led by the accused failed to help their cause and rather
gave credence to the prosecution case.
