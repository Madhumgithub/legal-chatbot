PW-2
6. PW-1, Sh. Nishant Saluja is the complainant in this case. PW-2, Sh. Pawan Kakkar is another
witness of the incident in this case. Therefore, this court deems it appropriate to discuss their
testimonies in a detailed manner.
7.1. PW-1, Sh. Nishant Saluja deposed that on 24.03.2015 at about 7:30 pm, PW-2 Pawan Kakkar
and he were present in the office situated at Tilak Nagar. Two young persons having covered their
faces with a cloth entered into the office. One had a pistol in his hand and another had a big knife.
Both directed to hand over all the cash to them. The boy holding the pistol pointed it towards PW-2
and hit its butt on head of Pawan due to which he received injury on his head. The person holding
the knife attacked him due to which he sustained cut injury on his right thumb. One cartridge had
fallen from pistol and knife also fell from the hand of the offenders. Having seen this, both the
offenders became perplexed. Thereafter, person holding the pistol ran outside the office. The boy
holding the knife also tried to run away from the office. However, PW-1 and PW-2 gathered the
courage and apprehended the boy who had the knife. His identity was revealed as accused Adatiya.
When the offenders were trying State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015
8/36 to run away, they were saying "Bhago Yakub". Two persons managed to escape from the spot
including the boy who had the pistol in his hand. Third person was standing outside the office. 7.2
He further deposed that one neighbour, namely, PW-4 Gurukirpal Singh called the police. Accused
Adatiya @ Akash was handed over to the police including the knife. The statement of PW-1, Ex.
PW-1/A was recorded. PW-1 further deposed about the preparation of the several documents and

proved the same. He also deposed that one TVS Star motor cycle was found stationed at some
distance from their office, which was also seized by the police.
7.3 He further deposed that third boy, being addressed as Yakub used to come to the office for
receiving payment and he had submitted documents of Yakub which he furnished in their office

accused Peter Joseph as the boy who had the pistol in his hand and he also identified accused Yakub
who ran away from the spot from outside of his office.
7.4. In the cross-examination by accused Peter, he stated that accused Peter was not arrested in his
presence. No CCTV cameras were installed inside and outside of his office or outside the shop of
Gurukirpal. He further stated that he had seen the pistol on the next day of the incident and that all
the accused were present in the PS Tilak Nagar in other room. He further stated that he identified
accused Peter Josef on the next date of incident in the PS. State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No.
55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 9/36 7.5. In the cross-examination by accused Yakub and Adatiya @
Akash he stated that he had two employees and one was present at the time of incident.
8.1. PW-2, Sh. Pawan Kakkar also deposed in the similar lines as deposed by PW-1 regarding the
incident. However, he did not depose about the fact that the accused Peter Joseph and Adatiya @
Akash demanded cash from them. He also identified the accused Yakub as the person who used to
come in their office for money transfer.
8.2. In the cross-examination by accused Peter, he stated that he did not participate in the TIP. He
admitted the suggestion of accused that only one knife was recovered in his presence but voluntarily
he stated that the cartridge was also taken into possession by the police. He further stated that he
did not identify accused Peter Joseph before identifying him in the court. 8.3 In the
cross-examination by accused Yakub and Adatiya @ Akash, he stated that in his presence no CCTV

11. During the trial, Sh. S.P Sharma, Ld. Counsel for accused Peter Joseph also made a statement
thereby not disputing the identity of vehicle bearing registration no. DL 9CG 7012.
The statement of accused persons u/s 313 Cr.P.C:
12. The statements of accused persons Yakub, Adatiya @ Akash and Peter u/s 313 Cr.P.C were
recorded. The incriminating circumstances appearing in evidence against the accused were brought
to their notice and their explanations were sought. Accused persons wished to lead defence
evidence.
Defence Evidence:
13. In defence, accused got examined three witnesses. Accused Peter examined Sh. Victor Joseph as
DW-1. Accused Yakub and Adatiya @ Akash examined themselves as DW-2 (though DW-2 should
be DW-3) after their application u/s 315 Cr.P.C were allowed.
14. The Ld. Prosecutor and the Ld. Counsel for the accused persons advanced the final arguments.
Submissions by Ld. Prosecutor:
15. Ld. Prosecutor while relying upon the oral and documentary evidence on the record argued that
the prosecution has been able to prove the case against the accused persons beyond reasonable
doubt. He further emphasized the testimonies State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR
No. 519/2015 11/36 of PW-1 and PW-2. He further argued that there is no motive on the part of
PW-1 and PW-2 to falsely implicate the accused persons in the offence. He further argued that knife
and a cartridge were recovered at the spot and that accused Adatiya @ Akash was also apprehended
at the spot.
Submissions by Ld. Counsel for accused persons :
16. On the other hand Ld counsel for accused persons argued that the prosecution has miserably
failed to prove the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. They further argued that one
of the main eye witness PW-4 Guru Kirpal Singh has turned hospital and did not support the
prosecution. Moreover, the knife allegedly recovered from the spot was also not sent to the FSL.
They further argued that the IO has failed to obtain finger prints from the spot. They further argued
that accused Peter and Yakub refused to participate in the judicial TIP as they were already shown
by the IO to the concerned witnesses. They further argued that despite the presence of CCTV
cameras near the spot, the IO has failed to file the same on record which effects the credibility of the
prosecution case at a great length. They further argued that IO has also failed to file on record the
CDR of Yakub to show that he was present at the spot at the relevant time.
Analysis:

17. It is settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that the prosecution has to prove the case against
the accused beyond reasonable doubt and the accused has to prove its defence on State Vs Mohd.
Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 12/36 preponderance of probabilities. What do
we mean by the expression 'beyond reasonable doubt'?
18. For our good fortune, the said expression has been defined by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
various judgments. In the judgment of Paramjeet Singh @ Pamma Vs. State of Uttarakhand,
2011CRI.L.J.663, Hon'ble Mr. Justice Dr. B. S. Chauhan, elaborated the concept of Standard of
Proof in a criminal trial in the following terms:
"11. A criminal trial is not a fairy tale wherein one is free to give flight to one's
imagination or fantasy. Crime is an event in real life and is the product of an interplay
between different human emotions. In arriving at a conclusion about the guilt of the
accused charged with commission of a crime, the court has to judge the evidence by
the yardstick of probabilities, intrinsic worth and the animus of witnesses. Every
case, in the final analysis, would have to depend upon its own facts. The court must
bear in mind that "human nature is too willing, when faced with brutal crimes, to
spin stories out of strong suspicions." Though an offence may be gruesome and revolt
the human conscience, an accused can be convicted only on legal evidence and not on
surmises and conjecture. The law does not permit the court to punish the accused on
the basis of a moral conviction or suspicion alone. "The burden of proof in a criminal
trial never shifts and it is always the burden of the prosecution to prove its case
beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of acceptable evidence." In fact, it is a settled
principle of criminal jurisprudence that the more serious the offence, the stricter the
degree of proof required, since a higher degree of assurance is required to convict the
accused. The fact that the offence was committed in a very cruel and revolting
manner may in itself be a reason for scrutinizing the evidence more closely, lest the
shocking nature of the crime induce an instinctive reaction against dispassionate
judicial scrutiny of the facts and law. (Vide: Kashmira Singh Vs. State of Madhya
Pradesh, AIR 1952 SC 159; State of Punjab Vs. Jagir Singh Baljit Singh & Anr. AIR
1973 SC 2407; Shankarlal Gyarasilal Dixit Vs. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1981 SC 765;
Mousam Singha Roy & Ors. Vs.State of West Bengal, (2003) 12 SCC 377; and Aloke
Nath Dutta & Ors. Vs. State of West Bengal, (2007) 12 SCC 230).
12. In Sarwan Sigh Rattan Singh Vs. State of Punjab, AIR 1957 SC 637, this court
observed (Para12) :
State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 13/36
"Considered as a whole the prosecution story may be true; but between 'may be true'
and 'must be true' there is inevitably a long distance to travel and the whole of this
distance must be covered by legal, reliable and unimpeachable evidence (before an
accused can be convicted."

19. Furthermore, in the judgment of Sucha Singh and Another Vs. State of Punjab, (2003 ) 7 SCC
643, the Hon'ble Supreme Court explained the term Beyond Reasonable Doubt and observed as
under:-
21. Exaggerated devotion to the rule of benefit of doubt must not nurture fanciful
doubts or lingering suspicion and thereby destroy social defence. Justice cannot be
made sterile on the plea that it is better to let hundred guilty escape than punish an
innocent. Letting guilty escape is not doing justice according to law. [See Gurbachan
Singh v.
Satpal Singh and others, AIR 1990 SC 209 : 1990(1) RCR(Crl.) 297 (SC)]. Prosecution is not
required to meet any and every hypothesis put forward by the accused. [See State of U.P. v. Ashok
Kumar Srivastava, AIR 1992 SC 840 :
1992(3) RCR(Crl.) 63 (SC)]. A reasonable doubt is not an imaginary, trivial or merely
possible doubt, but a fair doubt based upon reason and common sense. It must grow
out of the evidence in the case. If a case is proved perfectly, it is argued that it is
artificial; if a case has some flaws inevitable because human beings are prone to err, it
is argued that it is too imperfect. One wonders whether in the meticulous
hypersensitivity to eliminate a rare innocent from being punished, many guilty
persons must be allowed to escape. Proof beyond reasonable doubt is a guideline, not
a fetish. [See Inder Singh and Anr. v. State of (Delhi Admn.) (AIR 1978 SC 1091)].
Vague hunches cannot take place of judicial evaluation. "A judge does not preside
over a criminal trial, merely to see that no innocent man is punished. A judge also
presides to see that a guilty man does not escape. Both are public duties." (Per
Viscount Simon in Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecution (1944 AC (PC)
315) quoted in State of U.P. v. Anil Singh, AIR 1988 SC 1998). Doubts would be called
reasonable if they are free from a zest for abstract speculation. Law cannot afford any
favourite other than truth.
20. The accused persons have been charged for the offences u/s 393/394/397/398 IPC.
State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 14/36
21. Section 393 IPC reads as under:-
"Attempt to commit robbery- Whoever attempts to commit robbery shall be punished
with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall
also be liable to fine."
22. Section 394 IPC reads as under:-

"Voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery- If any person, in committing or in
attempting to commit robbery, voluntarily causes hurt, such person, and any other
person jointly concerned in committing or attempting to commit such robbery, shall
be punished with imprisonment for life, or with rigorous imprisonment for a term
which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine."
23. Section 397 reads as under:-
"397. Robbery, or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt.--
If, at the time of committing robbery or dacoity, the offender uses any deadly
weapon, or causes grievous hurt to any person, or attempts to cause death or grievous
hurt to any person, the imprisonment with which such offender shall be punished
shall not be less than seven years."
24. In the judgment of Dilawar Singh v. State of Delhi, (2007) 12 SCC 641, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court stated the essential ingredients of section 397 in the following manner:
"19. The essential ingredients of Section 397 IPC are as follows:
1. The accused committed robbery.
2. While committing robbery or dacoity (i) the accused used deadly weapon (ii) to
cause grievous hurt to any person (iii) attempted to cause death or grievous hurt to
any person.
3. "Offender" refers to only culprit who actually used deadly weapon. When only one
has used the deadly weapon, others cannot be awarded the minimum punishment. It
only envisages the State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No.
519/2015 15/36 individual liability and not any constructive liability.
Section 397 IPC is attracted only against the particular accused who uses the deadly weapon or does
any of the acts mentioned in the provision. But the other accused are not vicariously liable under
that section for acts of the co-accused."
25. Section 398 IPC reads as under:-
"398. Attempt to commit robbery or dacoity when armed with deadly weapon.--
If, at the time of attempting to commit robbery or dacoity, the offender is armed with
any deadly weapon, the imprisonment with which such offender shall be punished
shall not be less than seven years."

26. Section 398 IPC is applicable when at the time of attempting to6 commit robbery or dacoity, the
offender is armed with any deadly weapon.
27. Section 393 IPC is an attempt to commit robbery. Section 394 IPC is applicable in two situations.
First is when any person in committing or attempting to commit robbery voluntarily causes hurt,
then such person is liable u/s 394 IPC. The second situation is that when any person while
committing or attempting to commit robbery voluntarily causes hurt then such person and any
other person jointly concerned in commission or attempt to commit robbery become liable. Section
390 IPC defines robbery. It provides that when the hurt is caused in order to committing of the theft
or in committing the theft or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the
theft, the offender causes the offence of robbery. The basic difference u/s 390 IPC (punishing
section 392 IPC) and 394 IPC is that the hurt u/s 392 IPC is caused with a view of commit robbery
wherein u/s 394 IPC, the hurt is not necessary to commit theft. This can be understood by the use of
words 'for that end' in Section 390 IPC.
State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 16/36 Moreover, Section 392
IPC is applicable in a case of complete robbery and is not applicable where the robbery falls short of
completion and in other words there was only an attempt.
28. Section 397 IPC is applicable when at the time of committing robbery or dacoity, the offender
uses any deadly weapon or causes grievous hurt to any person or attempts to cause death or
grievous hurt to any person. It applies to the offender who uses the deadly weapon in commission of
the offence. It is settled law that the word 'use' does not mean that the weapon must have been
actually used. The word 'use' denotes that if the weapon is within the sight of the victim and was
capable of causing terror in his mind, then the offender can be said to have used the weapon. For
example, if the offender has hidden a pistol underneath the belt of his pants covered by the shirt not
tucked up into the pants and the offender shows the pistol by lifting the shirt in order to show the
pistol to the victim, the weapon can be said to have been used for the purpose of Section 397 IPC.
Furthermore, Section 397 is applicable to the situation where the offence of robbery is complete.
29. Section 398 IPC is applicable to the situation where the offender does not use the weapon but is
armed with any deadly weapon. Thus, the stark difference between Section 397 IPC and 398 IPC is
that u/s 397 IPC, the weapon must have been used but for the purpose of Section 398 IPC, it is not
necessary that the weapon must be used but it is sufficient if the offender is armed with deadly
weapon. Section 398 IPC is applicable where the offence of robbery or dacoity is not complete and
there remains an attempt only whereas S. 397 applies to a complete robbery.
State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 17/36
30. It is further settled that Section 397 and 398 IPC are not substantive offences but they only
regulate the punishment. In addition to that, it can be said that Section 392 IPC corresponds to
Section 397 IPC whereas Section 393 IPC corresponds to Section 398 IPC.

31. Before deciding the question whether the prosecution has been able to prove the case against the
accused beyond reasonable doubt or not, the court is of the opinion that the contentions of the
accused be dealt first.
Absence of independent public person:-
32. The first argument of Ld. Counsel for the accused persons was that no independent public
witness has been joined by the IO in the investigation and that the alleged independent public
witness, namely, PW-4 Guru Kirpal Singh did not support the prosecution case. Aforesaid
contention of the Ld. Counsel are in two parts, first is that no independent public witness has been
joined in the investigation which on the face of it is incorrect as PW-4 Guru Kirpal Singh is an
independent public witness who as per the case of the prosecution was a neighbour. The second part
of the contention was that PW-4 Guru Kirpal did not support the prosecution case. The court is not
in the agreement with the aforesaid submissions of the accused that no independent public person
has been examined which is clear from the fact that PW-4 is an independent witness.
33. A careful perusal of the testimony of PW-4 shows that he has supported the prosecution case as
far as the incident is concerned. He has deposed that on 24.03.2015, i.e. the date of State Vs Mohd.
Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 18/36 incident at about 7 or 7:30 pm when he
was at his shop, he heard some noise coming from the adjacent shop of Nishant. When he came out,
he saw that Nishant and his employee had caught hold of a person. One of the employees of Nishant
was bleeding from his head. Although he could not identify the said person, who was apprehended
by Nishant and his employee. The witness could not identify him in the court despite having a
glance over the persons present in the court, stating that he was unable to identify. He further
deposed that he came to know from the owner of the Nishant's shop that two persons had probably
entered into the said shop to commit robbery and out of which, one had fled away and the person
who had been caught was having a butcher's knife in his hand. He made a call to the SHO of local
police station from his mobile phone and police reached at the spot and had taken the assailant. He
further deposed that he had seen a bullet which was recovered from the assailant.
In the cross-examination, he stated that a bullet and knife were not subjected to police proceedings
in his presence and he had not noticed any crime team inspecting the crime scene. He further stated
that he was never called to participate in the TIP proceedings. He denied the suggestion that he
being neighbour of Nishant was an interested witness.
34. Therefore, the crux of his testimony was in the nature of res gestae. He has not seen the offence
but he has reached at the shop of Nishant so soon after the incident that whatever he has heard and
observed must fall within the definition of res gestae evidence as prescribed u/s 6 of Indian
Evidence Act. Although he did not identify accused Adatiya @ Akash in the court, but he State Vs
Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 19/36 specifically deposed about the
incident and the apprehension of one accused at the shop of Nishant. Thus, the testimony of PW-4
Guru Kirpal cannot be said to be completely hostile against the case of the prosecution. His
testimony definitely can be taken as corroborative piece of evidence to the testimony of PW-1 and
PW-2. Merely that he has failed to identify accused Adatiya @ Akash in the court does not mean that
State vs Mohd. Yakub Etc on 29 March, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20389847/
12

his testimony has turned into the nature of hostile evidence and goes against the prosecution case.
Therefore, this court is unable to accept the submissions of Ld. Counsel and accordingly, the
submissions stand rejected.
35. The next point vehemently raised by the Ld. Defence Counsel is that there are material
contradictions in the testimony of the prosecution witnesses. But here the question which assumes
importance is that what would amount to the material contradictions and what would not. In State
of Rajasthan Vs. Kalki (1981)2 SCC 752 the Hon'ble Supreme Court was pleased to held that as
under:-
"normal discrepancies in evidence are those which are due to normal errors of
observation, normal errors of memory due to lapse of time, due to mental disposition
such as shock and horror at the time of occurrence and those are always there,
however hones and truthful a witness may be. Material discrepancies are those which
are not normal, and not expected of a normal person. Courts have to label the
category to which a discrepancy may be categorized. While normal discrepancies do
not corrode the credibility of a party's case, material discrepancies do so."
36. Therefore, in view of the aforesaid observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Kalki (supra), the law regarding the contradictions and discrepancies are that unless and State Vs
Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 20/36 until the so-called contradictions
and discrepancies in the prosecution are not such that they go to the roots of the prosecution case
creating a reasonable doubt in prosecution story, then the normal discrepancies and contradictions
can be overlooked. The reason being that there may be several reasons for slight deviation, in the
manner of narrating the incident to the police at the early stage, could be caused because of the
limitation of the human memory, the ability to grasp the events minutely and the normal errors of
time. It also depends upon individual to individual as to how he perceives the incident and the role
ascribed to each accused. It is not normal for majority of the human beings who have just being
attacked by the offenders with a purpose to rob them with a deadly weapon such as pistol and knife
and to depose so minutely so as not to allow any minor deviation or discrepancy in the statements.
In view of these observations, if testimony of PW-1 and PW-2 is observed minutely, it reveals that
they both have supported the prosecution case in its material particulars as they both have deposed
about the two masked offenders, one with the knife and another with the pistol and also the manner
in which the incident had been committed with them. They had also correctly identified the accused
persons in the court as well as the case properties. No material contradictions and discrepancies
have been noted by this court in the oral and the documentary evidence prepared in that regard.
37. Although Ld. Counsel for the accused tried to make a mountain out of a molehill by submitting
that in the complaint Ex. PW-1/A, Nishant Saluja stated to police that the person State Vs Mohd.
Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 21/36 standing outside the gate shouted
"Adatiya, Yakub bhago yahan se jaldi" whereas, he deposed that the offenders while trying to run
away from the office were saying "Bhago Yakub". The Ld. Counsel argued that if Yakub was standing
outside the gate, then he could not have shouted his name and as per the statement Ex. PW-1/A, it
appears that accused Peter was standing outside and accused Yakub was in the office along with
State vs Mohd. Yakub Etc on 29 March, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20389847/
13

Adatiya @ Akash otherwise the person standing outside could not have raised the name of accused
Yakub. He argued that thus there is a reasonable doubt about the fact as to who were present in the
office and who was standing outside the gate.
Though the said argument appears to be interesting on its face, however, the cross-examination by
the accused shows that the accused persons have failed to cross-examine the witness PW-1 or
confronted the witness with the aforesaid fact. Hence, once the witness has not been given a chance
to explain the so- called part, therefore, the accused persons could not have raised any doubt about
the veracity of the statement and deposition of the complainant in the court. It is well settled
principle of law that if witness' testimony is to be challenged by a previous statement in writing then
the contention of the witness must be drawn to the said part of the writing and in case of failure
thereto, the testimony of the witness cannot be said to have been properly challenged and the
accused has to be said to have accepted the same. Thus, the court does not find any force in the said
submissions and same are rejected.
State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 22/36 Defects and lapses in
investigation:-
38. Ld. Counsel for accused further argued that the IO did not carry out proper investigation in a
professional manner which render the case of the prosecution doubtful. He particularly emphasized
on not lifting the chance print from the spot as well as the knife allegedly recovered from accused
Adatiya @ Akash was not sent to the FSL.
39. It is well settled principle of criminal law that the defective investigation should not give any
benefit to the accused if the case has otherwise been proved by the testimonies of the eye witnesses.
In Vishveswaran Vs. State (2003)6 SCC 73 in para 12 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as:
"........................It is also required to be kept in view that every defective investigation need not
necessarily result in the acquittal. In defective investigation, the only requirement is of extra caution
by courts while evaluating evidence. It would not be just to acquit the accused solely as a result of
defective investigation. Any deficiency or irregularity in investigation need not necessarily lead to
rejection of the case of the prosecution when it is otherwise proved.
40. In view of the aforesaid propositions of law, it is said that the minor lapses on the part of the IO
in the investigation should not cause any unreasonable doubt in the story of the prosecution and it is
only when prosecution case is suffering from inherent lacuna and embellishments in the
investigation which tents the prosecution story so much so that there is no plausible explanation
and it suffers the reasonable doubt to the extent that the accused cannot be found guilty on the basis
of State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 23/36 lapse in the
investigation. In the considered opinion of this court, the fact that IO did not sent the alleged
recovered knife to the FSL as well as did not take any chance print did not cause any severe damage
to the prosecution case especially, in view of the testimony of PW-1 Nishant and PW-2 Pawan
Kakkar.
State vs Mohd. Yakub Etc on 29 March, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20389847/

41. The next argument raised by the Ld. Counsel for accused persons is that the IO despite the
presence of CCTV camera near the spot has failed to collect the CCTV footage which would have
otherwise shown that no such offence as alleged by PW-1 and PW-2 had been committed by accused.
In this regard, it would be appropriate to discuss the testimony of prosecution witness PW-1
Nishant. In his cross-examination, he stated that the CCTV camera were not installed inside or
outside of his office nor any CCTV camera was installed at the shop of Guru Kirpal. Though he
stated that one CCTV camera was installed at A Daikin AC Showroom. Further, the accused
suggested to IO PW-14 Inspector Rajpal Meena that no CCTV camera was present at the spot which
the IO admitted. The IO further deposed that he did not take the footage of CCTV installed at the
shop of Guru Kirpal as the said CCTV was installed after one shop and the same did not have the
footage of the incident.
42. The accused persons did not file any application during trial or investigation that a neighbouring
shop had the CCTV footage which be directed to be preserved nor the accused summoned any
witness from the said shop. Moreover, there is nothing in the testimonies of PW-1 and PW-2 that
they had any motive for the false implication of the accused persons. Nothing State Vs Mohd. Yakub
& Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 24/36 could be elicit in the cross-examination of PW-1
and PW-2 to that effect. Hence, the court is not in agreement with the contentions of the Ld.
Counsel that no CCTV footage having been filed on the record, gave rise to a reasonable doubt in
their favour. Accordingly, the same stands rejected.
43. Having discussed the different pleas of the accused persons, now let us see if the prosecution has
been able to prove the offences with which accused persons have been charged. To decide the same,
we again have to revert back to the testimonies of PW-1 Nishant and PW-2 Pawan Kakkar. A careful
perusal of their testimonies would show that the accused Adatiya@ Akash and Peter Joseph entered
to their office alongwith knife and pistol respectively. They both have deposed that accused Adatiya
@ Akash caused hurt with a knife on the person of PW-1 Nishant and accused Peter Joseph hit the
butt of the pistol on the head of PW-2 Pawan Kakkar. It is to be seen whether the oral version of
PW-1 and PW-2 find any corroboration from the medical documents on the record or not. The MLC
Ex.PW-11/A of PW-1 Nishant shows that he was brought to the hospital at about 10 p.m on
24.03.2015 where doctor noted superficial incised wound over right thumb. PW-1 Nishant deposed
that when accused Adatiya@ Akash attacked him, he tried to ward off the attack with his hand due
to which he sustained cut injury on his right thumb. Thus, MLC Ex.PW-11/A corroborates the oral
version of PW-1 Nishant.
44. Similarly, MLC Ex.PW-11/B of PW-2 Pawan Kakkar would reveal that he was brought in the
hospital on 24.03.2015 at about 9.45 p.m. Doctor noted CLW over right parietal region of State Vs
Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 25/36 the skull as well as abrasion over
left zygomatic bone. The zygomatic bone is a bone on the cheek of a human being. Thus, the injury
on the MLC of PW-2 also corroborates the version of both the PWs.
45. The Ld. Counsel for accused tried to show from the medical document of the witnesses that the
witnesses were not brought together at the hospital. They pointed out that as per the MLC
Ex.PW-11/B, the time of arrival of PW-2 was shown as 9.45 p.m whereas as per the MLC
State vs Mohd. Yakub Etc on 29 March, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20389847/
15

Ex.PW-11/A of PW-1, the time of arrival was shown as 10 p.m. However, this court is not willing to
accept the contentions of the Ld. Counsel for the reasons, firstly that the serial number of MLC
Ex.PW-11/B is 399 whereas the serial number of MLC Ex.PW-11/A is 4000. Thus, the record implies
that MLC of PW-2 was firstly made and doctor then examined PW-1. Merely that doctor had noted
different time on the MLC, does not lead the inference that both the persons were not brought
together in the hospital. It is quite possible that the concerned doctor after having prepared his MLC
noted down the time of 10 p.m when he started preparing second MLC. Moreover, no
cross-examination has been conducted on this aspect by the accused persons from PW-11 Dr.
Dhananjay Kumar who proved the MLC. Accordingly, the contention of the accused persons stands
rejected.
46. However, it is also an admitted fact on the record that both the eye witnesses i.e. PW-1 and PW-2
did not depose specifically that any article or money was robbed by the accused persons namely
Peter Joseph and Adatiya @ Akash or something was taken away by them. Thus, the question arises
herein as to what State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 26/36 offence
has been committed by the accused persons. It is clear from the language of Section 392 IPC that it
is only applicable when a robbery has been committed. Section 393 IPC is only an attempt. Section
394 IPC applies into a case where robbery has been committed as well as where there has been only
an attempt to commit robbery when hurt was caused voluntarily by one person and any other
person was jointly concerned in committing or in attempting to commit robbery. Similarly, Section
397 IPC is applicable to a situation where robbery is completed. Further. Section 398 IPC is
applicable to an attempt to commit robbery or dacoity when offender is armed with a deadly
weapon. It is also settled law that sections 397 and 398 IPC are not substantiative offences, but they
merely regulates punishment.
47. Thus, it is clear that in view of the manner of the incident, it is clear that no complete robbery
has been taken place. It was only an attempt by accused persons namely Adatiya@ Akash and Peter
Joseph. It is also clear that accused Adatiya@ Akash and accused Peter Joseph were armed with a
knife and a pistole respectively. The seizure memo Ex.PW-1/D of the knife would show that it has
total length of 32.5 cm with length of the blade as 20 cm and width of blade as 4.5 cm and the
handle of the knife having length as 12.5 cm. The measurement of the knife would show that it was
quite a big knife. The next question which arises here is whether the said knife can be a deadly
weapon or not. It is settled that the knife per se is not a deadly weapon and the use and manner
thereto makes any knife a dangerous weapon. The said knife has been used for the commission of
robbery and injury was caused to injured PW-1 as well and thus, considering State Vs Mohd. Yakub
& Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 27/36 the measurement of the knife, this court is of the
opinion that the knife Ex.P-1 was a deadly weapon.
48. As far as the role of accused Peter Joseph in the alleged commission of offence is concerned,
both the PWs have corroborated each other that accused Peter Joseph hit the but of the pistol on the
head of PW-2 Pawan Kakkar and during the attach a cartridge fell down from the pistol. Though the
Ld. Counsel has argued that the pistol has not been recovered at the spot, but it is a trite law that the
recovery of a deadly weapon or pistol is not necessary and accordingly, the testimonies of PW-1 and
PW-2 are safe to prove that accused Peter had the possession of one pistol out of which one
State vs Mohd. Yakub Etc on 29 March, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20389847/
16

cartridge fell down. This, it can be safely concluded that accused Peter has also the possession of a
deadly weapon i.e. a pistole with him while attempting to commit robbery.
49. Now remains, the role and involvement of accused Mohd. Yakub. Both the witnesses PW-1 and
PW-2 have categorically deposed individually that accused Adatiya@ Akash and accused Peter
Joseph tried to run away from the office and accused Peter Joseph managed to escape from the
offence while shouting for his third companion. The identity of the third companion i.e. Mohd.
Yakub has also been established by the prosecution through the testimonies of PW-1 and PW-2 as
Mohd. Yakub used to come to their office in connection to collect the money received from money
transfer.
50. Thus, the prosecution has been able to prove that while accused Adatiya@ Akash and Peter
Joseph entered into office, accused Yakub remained outside the gate of the office. Hence, it State Vs
Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 28/36 is held that the prosecution has
been able to prove the case against the accused persons for the offence u/s 394/34 IPC as well as u/s
398 IPC individually against accused Adatiya@ Akash and Peter Joseph.
51. Now, let use discuss other charges against accused namely Adatiya@ Akash and Peter. Accused
Adatiya@ Akash has also been charged for the offence u/s 25 & 27 Arms Act, 1959 as he was found
in possession of a knife at the time of commission of robbery. Whether such knife was covered under
the provisions of Section 25 or 27 Arms Act or not, is to be seen. The Governments of NCT of Delhi
under the power conferred in pursuance of the Arms Act, 1959 had issued notification which
regulates that the sale, manufacturing and possession of such knives, is an offence. Vide DAD
notification dated 29.10.1980, the Governments of NCT of Delhi has provided for the regulation
regarding the possession, sealer and manufacturing of the knife. The said notification reads as
under:-
"Case File (25/54/59 Arms Act) (Knife) Notification regarding length and breadth of
Knife DAD Notification (To be Published in Part IV of Deli Gazette) (Extra Ordinary)
Delhi Administration, Delhi Notification Dated the 29th October, 1980 No.
F/13/451/79-Home (G) - Whereas the administration is of the opinion that having

Appointed Date expedient in the public interest, 'to regulate the manufacture sale or

hold a licence issued in accordance with provisions of the Arms Act, 1959 (No. 64 of
1959) and Arms Rule, 1962 framed thereunder with effect from the publication of this
Notification in Delhi Gazette.
Sd/-

F-13/451/179 (Home General) dt. 29.10.1980 This is necessary to be included in the
case file."
(emphasis supplied)"
52. A careful perusal of the aforesaid notification shows that it is applicable only to spring actuated
knives, gararidar knives, buttondar knives as well as other knives. The notification shows that there
are two categories of knives, one is spring actuated knives, gararidar knives, buttondar knives in
which type of knives, the length of blade or total length of knife or breadth of blade is not material
and the second category of knife is that where knife opens or closes with other mechanical device
and also has the requisite length and breadth in accordance with the State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC
No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 30/36 notification. Thus, the length of blade or total length of
knife or breadth of blade is important in second type of knives.
53. Considering the knife recovered in this case, it is seen that the knife recovered in this case is not
a knife which could be open or close with a mechanical device. Thus, though total length of blade,
total length of knife and breadth of blade is covered within the parameters required thereto, but in
view of the fact that the knife recovered in this case was not operated with any mechanical device to
open or close it, did not make the knife to be covered under Arms Act, Thus, the prosecution has
failed to prove the offence u/s 25/27 Arms Act against the accused Adatiya@ Akash as the knife
recovered from his was not covered within the parameters of DAD notification dated 29.10.1980.
54. Now comes the question whether the cartridge recovered at the spot which allegedly fell from the
pistol, held by the Peter is an ammunition or not. As per the case of the prosecution, the pistole was
recovered at the instance of accused Peter from a car parked infornt of H. No. 777, JJ Colony,
Khyala, New Delhi. The said country made pistol was recovered alongwith live cartridge from
underneath of the driving seat of the car. The said pistole alongwith cartridge recovered at the spot
as well as live cartridge were sent to the FSL. The FSL report Ex.AD-2 admitted by accused would
show that the cartridge Mark as Ex.A-1 recovered from the spot was found to be a misfired cartridge.
The FSL report further states that the individual characteristics of fired pin dent mark present on
cartridge Ex.A1 and test fired cartridge from the country made pistol recovered from accused Peter,
State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 31/36 cannot be proved having
fired from the country made pistol by accused Peter. Therefore, the FSL report has failed to prove
that the cartridge recovered at the spot Mark Ex.A-1 had no connection with the pistol recovered
from accused Peter Joseph. Moreover, the cartridge Mark Ex.A-1 is a misfired cartridge.

55. In the judgment of Tehar Vs State of M.P, Misc. CRIMINAL CASE No. 57707 of 2022, dated
13.12.2022, the Hon'ble High Court of MP held that empty cartridge is not an ammunition. While
relying upon the judgment of the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi reported as 2012 (130) DRJ 504 held
that even live cartridge is a minor ammunition. The Hon'ble High Court of MP observed that in view
of the definition of 'ammunition' under section 2(i)(a)(iii) of Arms Act r/w definition of 'cartridge'
under Rule 2 (12) of the Arms Rule, 2016, an empty cartridge is not an ammunition. As per the
definition of the cartridge, the cartridge means a complete object consisting of a cartridge case,
primer, propellant, bullet or any single or multiple projectile. Thus, a mis-fired cartridge is also
clearly not an ammunition. Hence, accused Peter Joseph cannot be convicted for the offence u/s 25
Arms Act for having possession of cartridge Mark Ex.A-1. Accordingly, he stands acquitted for the
offence u/s 25 Arms Act in respect to the empty cartridge recovered at the spot.
56. The next question, which arises is whether accused Peter Joseph could be held liable for the
possession of the country made pistol containing a live cartridge allegedly recovered at his instance
from underneath driving seat of the car.
State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 32/36
57. After having carefully gone through the prosecution evidence in this regard, this court is of the
opinion that the alleged recovery of country made pistol containing one live cartridge at the instance
of accused Peter Joseph from his case is not free from embellishments or doubt. PW-14 IO Inspector
Raj Pal Meena deposed that 25.03.2015 he prepared a raiding party consisting of himself, Ct. Ombir,
Ct. Mahavir Singh and HC Sunil (PW-14, PW-7, PW-9 and PW-13 respectively). The seizure memo
Ex.PW-13/C of the country made pistol containing the live cartridge shows that it was got recovered
by accused Peter Joseph from underneath the driver seat of silver colour Accent Car bearing no.
DL9CG 7012. IO PW-14 Inspector Raj Pal deposed the same as well. However, the other members of
the police team did not corroborate his versions. PW-13 ASI Sunil deposed that the pistol was got
recovered by the accused persons near the driver seat of the car. PW-9 HC Mahavir Singh also
deposed that the pistol was got recovered by the accused persons from near the driver seat of the
car. Thus, there is a reasonable doubt as to the exact place from where the alleged pistol containing
live cartridge was recovered.
58. Moreover, there is also a reasonable doubt about the fact that as to how the silver colour Accent
Car bearing no. DL9CG 7012 was brought to the police station. PW-13 ASI Sunil deposed that he was
not aware as to who brought the said car to the police station. However, PW-9 HC Mahavir Singh
deposed that the said car was brought to the police station by HC Sunil (PW-13). If PW-13 HC Sunil
brought the car to the police station, he would State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR
No. 519/2015 33/36 not have forgotten the same. Thus, a reasonable doubt has crept in the
prosecution story in regard to the aforesaid fact.
59. Another infirmity in the prosecution case in regard to the aforesaid fact is that PW-7 HC Ombir
Singh was also part of the raiding team which recovered the country made pistol containing a live
cartridge and the Accent Car of the accused Peter Joseph. PW-14 IO Inspector Raj Pal deposed that
same. However, PW-9 HC Mahavir Singh and PW-13 ASI Sunil did not depose if Ct. Ombir Singh

was also the part of the raiding party on 25.03.215 at the time of recovery of country made pistol and
Accent Car. PW-7 Ct. Ombir Singh himself did not depose anything if he also took part in the
investigation on 25.03.2015. Therefore, a doubt remains if PW-7 Ct. Ombir Singh was involved in
the investigation on 25.03.2015 or not.
60. Another lacunae in the prosecution case which makes the recovery of country made pistol
including a live cartridge as unbelievable is that as per the FSL report Ex.AD-2, the FSL expert
opined that no opinion could be given if the misfired cartridge Ex.A-1 was caused by the country
made pistol recovered from accused Peter Joseph. Thus, the FSL report failed to connect the
misfired cartridge Ex.A-1 with the country made pistol allegedly recovered from the possession of
accused Peter Joseph. Therefore, in the absence of the evidence to connect the alleged pistol with
the misfired cartridge recovered at the spot, the accused Peter Joseph could not have been tried for
the offence u/s 25 Arms Act as well. Hence, accused Peter Joseph stands acquitted from the offence
u/s 25 Arms Act for possession of country made pistol including a live cartridge.
State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 34/36
61. At this stage, it would be appropriate to discuss the defence evidence led by the accused. Peter
Jospeh examined his father Victor Joseph as DW-1 to prove the fact that Peter Joseph was picked up
on 25.03.2015 from his house. The arrest memo Ex.PW-13/A of Peter Joseph shows that he was
arrested on 25.03.2015 at about 10.30 a.m from his house only. The arrest memo shows that his
mother Ms. Anita Joseph was given the information about his arrest. In the cross-examination,
DW-1 admitted that his wife was present in the house on that day. Hence, the testimony of DW-1 did
not yield any favour to the accused rather it provides corroboration to the prosecution case.
62. Accused Mohd. Yakub examined himself. He deposed that on 24.03.2015, he was present at his
house and brought some fruits and vegetables from the market. He gave it to his children. In the
cross-examination, he admitted that he knew Nishant Saluja. He also admitted that prior to the
incident of this case, he had visited the office of the complainant to collect payment of Western
Union money transfer. Thus, he provided corroboration to the prosecution case that he had been
visiting the office of the complainant before the incident as well.
63. Accused Adatiya @ Akash also examined himself as DW. He also admitted his presence on
24.03.2015 at about 7 p.m near the shop of the complainant. He deposed that he alongwith his
brother in law Sandeep were getting the tyre of their car changed and in the meanwhile there was
chaos and accordingly, they reached at the shop of Nishant. Thereafter, because of some confusion,
he was beaten and handed over to the police. Thus, he also admitted his presence at the shop of
complainant Nishant at State Vs Mohd. Yakub & Ors SC No. 55893/2016 FIR No. 519/2015 35/36
the time of the incident.
64. Thus, the defence evidence led by the accused persons would shows that it did not help the
accused persons rather their depositions provided the corroboration to the prosecution case.
Therefore, it is held that the defence evidence led by the accused failed to help their cause and rather
gave credence to the prosecution case.
